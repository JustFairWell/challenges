\\nMountains on whose barren breast \\nThe labouring clouds do often rest; \\nMeadows trim with daisies pied, \\nShallow brooks, and rivers wide. \\nTowers, and battlements it sees \\nBosom'd high in tufted trees, \\nWhere perhaps some beauty lies, \\nThe cynosure of neighbouring eyes. \\nHard by, a cottage chimney smokes, \\nFrom betwixt two aged oaks, \\nWhere Corydon and Thyrsis met, \\nAre at their savoury dinner set \\nOf herbs, and other country messes, \\nWhich the neat-handed Phyllis dresses; \\nAnd then in haste her bow'r she leaves, \\nWith Thestylis to bind the sheaves; \\nOr if the earlier season lead \\nTo the tann'd haycock in the mead. \\nSometimes with secure delight \\nThe upland hamlets will invite, \\nWhen the merry bells ring round, \\nAnd the jocund rebecks sound \\nTo many a youth, and many a maid, \\nDancing in the chequer'd shade; \\nAnd young and old come forth to play \\nOn a sunshine holiday, \\nTill the live-long daylight fail; \\nThen to the spicy nut-brown ale, \\nWith stories told of many a feat, \\nHow Faery Mab the junkets eat, \\nShe was pinch'd and pull'd she said, \\nAnd he by friar's lanthorn led, \\nTells how the drudging goblin sweat, \\nTo earn his cream-bowl duly set, \\nWhen in one night, ere glimpse of morn, \\nHis shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn \\nThat ten day-labourers could not end; \\nThen lies him down, the lubber fiend, \\nAnd stretch'd out all the chimney's length, \\nBasks at the fire his hairy strength; \\nAnd crop-full out of doors he flings, \\nEre the first cock his matin rings. \\nThus done the tales, to bed they creep, \\nBy whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. \\nTower'd cities please us then, \\nAnd the busy hum of men, \\nWhere throngs of knights and barons bold, \\nIn weeds of peace high triumphs hold, \\nWith store of ladies, whose bright eyes \\nRain influence, and judge the prize \\nOf wit, or arms, while both contend \\nTo win her grace, whom all commend. \\nThere let Hymen oft appear \\nIn saffron robe, with taper clear, \\nAnd pomp, and feast, and revelry, \\nWith mask, and antique pageantry;

\\nThat Orpheus' self may heave his head \\nFrom golden slumber on a bed \\nOf heap'd Elysian flow'rs, and hear \\nSuch strains as would have won the ear \\nOf Pluto, to have quite set free \\nHis half-regain'd Eurydice. \\nThese delights if thou canst give, \\nMirth, with thee I mean to live. \", 'ï»¿What beck\\'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade \\nInvites my steps, and points to yonder glade? \\n\\'Tis she!â€”but why that bleeding bosom gor\\'d, \\nWhy dimly gleams the visionary sword? \\nOh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell, \\nIs it, in heav\\'n, a crime to love too well? \\nTo bear too tender, or too firm a heart, \\nTo act a lover\\'s or a Roman\\'s part? \\nIs there no bright reversion in the sky, \\nFor those who greatly think, or bravely die? \\n\\nWhy bade ye else, ye pow\\'rs! her soul aspire \\nAbove the vulgar flight of low desire? \\nAmbition first sprung from your blest abodes;

her one we don't like terrible diseases, then we go eat some fish and some ale it's cool but crowded we don't like lionel trilling we decide, we like don allen we don't like henry james so much we like herman melville we don't want to be in the poets' walk in san francisco even we just want to be rich and walk on girders in our silver hats i wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is thinking

phoenix and the turtle fled in a mutual flame from hence. so they lov'd, as love in twain had the essence but in one; two distincts, division none: number there in love was slain. hearts remote, yet not asunder; distance and no space was seen 'twixt this turtle and his queen: but in them it were a wonder. so between them love did shine that the turtle saw his right flaming in the phoenix' sight: either was the other's mine. property was thus appalled that the self was not the same; single nature's double name neither two nor one was called. reason, in itself confounded, saw division grow together, to themselves yet either neither, simple were so well compounded; that it cried, \"how true a twain seemeth this concordant one! love has reason, reason none, if what parts can so remain.\" whereupon it made this threne to the phoenix and the dove, co-supremes and stars of love, as chorus to their tragic scene: threnos beauty, truth, and rarity, grace in all simplicity, here enclos'd, in cinders lie. death is now the phoenix' nest, and the turtle's loyal breast to eternity doth rest, leaving no posterity: 'twas not their infirmity, it was married chastity. truth may seem but cannot be; beauty brag but 'tis not she; truth and beauty buried be. to this urn let those repair that are either true or fair; for these dead birds sigh a prayer., shall i compare thee to a summers day? thou art more lovely and more temperate: rough winds do shake the darling buds of may, and summers lease hath all too short a date; sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines, and often is his gold complexion dimm'd; and every fair from fair sometime declines, by chance or natures changing course untrimm'd; but thy eternal summer shall not fade, nor lose possession of that fair thou owst; nor shall death brag thou wanderst in his shade, when in eternal lines to time thou growst: so long as men can breathe or eyes can see, so long lives this, and this gives life to thee., let those who are in favour with their stars of public honour and proud titles boast, whilst i, whom fortune of such triumph bars, unlook'd for joy in that i honour most. great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread but as the marigold at the sun's eye, and in themselves their pride lies buried, for at a frown they in their glory die. the painful warrior famoused for fight, after a thousand victories once foil'd, is from the book of honour razed quite, and all the rest forgot for which he toil'd: then happy i, that love and am beloved where i may not remove nor be removed., farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing, and like enough thou knowst thy estimate. the charter of thy worth gives thee releasing; my bonds in thee are all determinate. for how do i hold thee but by thy granting, and for that riches where is my deserving? the cause of this fair gift in me is wanting, and so my patent back again is swerving. thy self thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing, or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking, so thy great gift, upon misprision growing, comes home again, on better judgement making. thus have i had thee as a dream doth flatter: in sleep a king, but waking no such matter., no longer mourn for me when i am dead than you shall hear the surly sullen bell give warning to the world that i am fled from this vile world with vilest worms to dwell; nay, if you read this line, remember not the hand that writ it; for i love you so, that i in your sweet thoughts would be forgot, if thinking on me then should make you woe. o, if (i say) you look upon this verse, when i (perhaps) compounded am with clay, do not so much as my poor name rehearse, but let your love even with my life decay, lest the wise world should look into your moan, and mock you with me after i am gone., blest pair of sirens, pledges of heav'ns joy, sphear-born harmonious sisters, voice, and vers, wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce, and to our high-rais'd phantasie present, that undisturbã¨d song of pure content, ay sung before the saphire-colour'd throne to him that sits theron with saintly shout, and solemn jubily, where the bright seraphim in burning row their loud up-lifted angel trumpets blow, and the cherubick host in thousand quires touch their immortal harps of golden wires, with those just spirits that wear victorious palms, hymns devout and holy psalms singing everlastingly; that we on earth with undiscording voice may rightly answer that melodious noise; as once we did, till disproportion'd sin jarr'd against natures chime, and with harsh din broke the fair musick that all creatures made to their great lord, whose love their motion swayd in perfect diapason, whilst they stood in first obedience, and their state of good. o may we soon again renew that song and keep in tune with heav'n, till god ere long to his celestial consort us unite, to live with him, and sing in endles morn of light., what needs my shakespeare for his honoured bones, the labor of an age in pilã¨d stones, or that his hallowed relics should be hid under a star-ypointing pyramid? dear son of memory, great heir of fame, what needst thou such weak witness of thy name? thou in our wonder and astonishment hast built thyself a live-long monument. for whilst to th shame of slow-endeavouring art, thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book those delphic lines with deep impression took, then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving, dost make us marble with too much conceiving; and so sepãºlchred in such pomp dost lie, that kings for such a tomb would wish to die., how soon hath time, the subtle thief of youth, stol'n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year! my hasting days fly on with full career, but my late spring no bud or blossom shew'th. perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth that i to manhood am arriv'd so near; and inward ripeness doth much less appear, that some more timely-happy spirits endu'th. yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, it shall be still in strictest measure ev'n to that same lot, however mean or high, toward which time leads me, and the will of heav'n: all is, if i have grace to use it so as ever in my great task-master's eye., hence loathed melancholy, of cerberus, and blackest midnight born, in stygian cave forlorn, 'mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy; find out some uncouth cell, where brooding darkness spreads his jealous wings, and the night-raven sings; there under ebon shades, and low-brow'd rocks, as ragged as thy locks, in dark cimmerian desert ever dwell. but come thou goddess fair and free, in heav'n yclep'd euphrosyne, and by men, heart-easing mirth, whom lovely venus at a birth with two sister graces more to ivy-crowned bacchus bore; or whether (as some sager sing) the frolic wind that breathes the spring, zephyr, with aurora playing, as he met her once a-maying, there on beds of violets blue, and fresh-blown roses wash'd in dew, fill'd her with thee, a daughter fair, so buxom, blithe, and debonair. haste thee nymph, and bring with thee jest and youthful jollity, quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, such as hang on hebe's cheek, and love to live in dimple sleek; sport that wrinkled care derides, and laughter holding both his sides. come, and trip it as ye go on the light fantastic toe, and in thy right hand lead with thee, the mountain-nymph, sweet liberty; and if i give thee honour due, mirth, admit me of thy crew to live with her, and live with thee, in unreproved pleasures free; to hear the lark begin his flight, and singing startle the dull night, from his watch-tower in the skies, till the dappled dawn doth rise; then to come in spite of sorrow, and at my window bid good-morrow, through the sweet-briar, or the vine, or the twisted eglantine; while the cock with lively din, scatters the rear of darkness thin, and to the stack, or the barn door, stoutly struts his dames before; oft list'ning how the hounds and horn cheerly rouse the slumb'ring morn, from the side of some hoar hill, through the high wood echoing shrill. sometime walking, not unseen, by hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, right against the eastern gate, where the great sun begins his state, rob'd in flames, and amber light, the clouds in thousand liveries dight. while the ploughman near at hand, whistles o'er the furrow'd land, and the milkmaid singeth blithe, and the mower whets his scythe, and every shepherd tells his tale under the hawthorn in the dale. straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures whilst the landskip round it measures, russet lawns, and fallows gray, where the nibbling flocks do stray; mountains on whose barren breast the labouring clouds do often rest; meadows trim with daisies pied, shallow brooks, and rivers wide. towers, and battlements it sees bosom'd high in tufted trees, where perhaps some beauty lies, the cynosure of neighbouring eyes. hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, from betwixt two aged oaks, where corydon and thyrsis met, are at their savoury dinner set of herbs, and other country messes, which the neat-handed phyllis dresses; and then in haste her bow'r she leaves, with thestylis to bind the sheaves; or if the earlier season lead to the tann'd haycock in the mead. sometimes with secure delight the upland hamlets will invite, when the merry bells ring round, and the jocund rebecks sound to many a youth, and many a maid, dancing in the chequer'd shade; and young and old come forth to play on a sunshine holiday, till the live-long daylight fail; then to the spicy nut-brown ale, with stories told of many a feat, how faery mab the junkets eat, she was pinch'd and pull'd she said, and he by friar's lanthorn led, tells how the drudging goblin sweat, to earn his cream-bowl duly set, when in one night, ere glimpse of morn, his shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn that ten day-labourers could not end; then lies him down, the lubber fiend, and stretch'd out all the chimney's length, basks at the fire his hairy strength; and crop-full out of doors he flings, ere the first cock his matin rings. thus done the tales, to bed they creep, by whispering winds soon lull'd asleep. tower'd cities please us then, and the busy hum of men, where throngs of knights and barons bold, in weeds of peace high triumphs hold, with store of ladies, whose bright eyes rain influence, and judge the prize of wit, or arms, while both contend to win her grace, whom all commend. there let hymen oft appear in saffron robe, with taper clear, and pomp, and feast, and revelry, with mask, and antique pageantry; such sights as youthful poets dream on summer eves by haunted stream. then to the well-trod stage anon, if jonson's learned sock be on, or sweetest shakespeare, fancy's child, warble his native wood-notes wild. and ever against eating cares, lap me in soft lydian airs, married to immortal verse, such as the meeting soul may pierce in notes with many a winding bout of linked sweetness long drawn out, with wanton heed, and giddy cunning, the melting voice through mazes running, untwisting all the chains that tie the hidden soul of harmony; that orpheus' self may heave his head from golden slumber on a bed of heap'd elysian flow'rs, and hear such strains as would have won the ear of pluto, to have quite set free his half-regain'd eurydice. these delights if thou canst give, mirth, with thee i mean to live., what beck'ning ghost, along the moon-light shade invites my steps, and points to yonder glade? 'tis she!”but why that bleeding bosom gor'd, why dimly gleams the visionary sword? oh ever beauteous, ever friendly! tell, is it, in heav'n, a crime to love too well? to bear too tender, or too firm a heart, to act a lover's or a roman's part? is there no bright reversion in the sky, for those who greatly think, or bravely die? why bade ye else, ye pow'rs! her soul aspire above the vulgar flight of low desire? ambition first sprung from your blest abodes; the glorious fault of angels and of gods; thence to their images on earth it flows, and in the breasts of kings and heroes glows. most souls, 'tis true, but peep out once an age, dull sullen pris'ners in the body's cage: dim lights of life, that burn a length of years useless, unseen, as lamps in sepulchres; like eastern kings a lazy state they keep, and close confin'd to their own palace, sleep. from these perhaps (ere nature bade her die) fate snatch'd her early to the pitying sky. as into air the purer spirits flow, and sep'rate from their kindred dregs below; so flew the soul to its congenial place, nor left one virtue to redeem her race. but thou, false guardian of a charge too good, thou, mean deserter of thy brother's blood! see on these ruby lips the trembling breath, these cheeks now fading at the blast of death: cold is that breast which warm'd the world before, and those love-darting eyes must roll no more. thus, if eternal justice rules the ball, thus shall your wives, and thus your children fall; on all the line a sudden vengeance waits, and frequent hearses shall besiege your gates. there passengers shall stand, and pointing say, (while the long fun'rals blacken all the way) \"lo these were they, whose souls the furies steel'd, and curs'd with hearts unknowing how to yield. thus unlamented pass the proud away, the gaze of fools, and pageant of a day! so perish all, whose breast ne'er learn'd to glow for others' good, or melt at others' woe.\" what can atone (oh ever-injur'd shade!) thy fate unpitied, and thy rites unpaid? no friend's complaint, no kind domestic tear pleas'd thy pale ghost, or grac'd thy mournful bier. by foreign hands thy dying eyes were clos'd, by foreign hands thy decent limbs compos'd, by foreign hands thy humble grave adorn'd, by strangers honour'd, and by strangers mourn'd! what though no friends in sable weeds appear, grieve for an hour, perhaps, then mourn a year, and bear about the mockery of woe to midnight dances, and the public show? what though no weeping loves thy ashes grace, nor polish'd marble emulate thy face? what though no sacred earth allow thee room, nor hallow'd dirge be mutter'd o'er thy tomb? yet shall thy grave with rising flow'rs be drest, and the green turf lie lightly on thy breast: there shall the morn her earliest tears bestow, there the first roses of the year shall blow; while angels with their silver wings o'ershade the ground, now sacred by thy reliques made. so peaceful rests, without a stone, a name, what once had beauty, titles, wealth, and fame. how lov'd, how honour'd once, avails thee not, to whom related, or by whom begot; a heap of dust alone remains of thee, 'tis all thou art, and all the proud shall be! poets themselves must fall, like those they sung, deaf the prais'd ear, and mute the tuneful tongue. ev'n he, whose soul now melts in mournful lays, shall shortly want the gen'rous tear he pays; then from his closing eyes thy form shall part, and the last pang shall tear thee from his heart, life's idle business at one gasp be o'er, the muse forgot, and thou belov'd no more!, you know where you did despise (tother day) my little eyes, little legs, and little thighs, and some things, of little size, you know where. you, tis true, have fine black eyes, taper legs, and tempting thighs, yet what more than all we prize is a thing of little size, you know where., father of all! in every age, in every clime adored, by saint, by savage, and by sage, jehovah, jove, or lord! thou great first cause, least understood: who all my sense confined to know but this”that thou art good, and that myself am blind: yet gave me, in this dark estate, to see the good from ill; and binding nature fast in fate, left free the human will. what conscience dictates to be done, or warns me not to do, this, teach me more than hell to shun, that, more than heaven pursue. what blessings thy free bounty gives, let me not cast away; for god is paid when man receives, to enjoy is to obey. yet not to earths contracted span, thy goodness let me bound, or think thee lord alone of man, when thousand worlds are round: let not this weak, unknowing hand presume thy bolts to throw, and deal damnation round the land, on each i judge thy foe. if i am right, thy grace impart, still in the right to stay; if i am wrong, oh teach my heart to find a better way. save me alike from foolish pride, or impious discontent, at aught thy wisdom has denied, or aught thy goodness lent. teach me to feel anothers woe, to hide the fault i see; that mercy i to others show, that mercy show to me. mean though i am, not wholly so since quickened by thy breath; oh lead me wheresoeer i go, through this days life or death. this day, be bread and peace my lot: all else beneath the sun, thou knowst if best bestowed or not, and let thy will be done. to thee, whose temple is all space, whose altar, earth, sea, skies! one chorus let all being raise! all natures incense rise!, happy the man, whose wish and care a few paternal acres bound, content to breathe his native air, in his own ground. whose herds with milk, whose fields with bread, whose flocks supply him with attire, whose trees in summer yield him shade, in winter fire. blest, who can unconcernedly find hours, days, and years slide soft away, in health of body, peace of mind, quiet by day, sound sleep by night; study and ease, together mixed; sweet recreation; and innocence, which most does please, with meditation. thus let me live, unseen, unknown; thus unlamented let me die; steal from the world, and not a stone tell where i lie., centre of equal daughters, equal sons, all, all alike endeard, grown, ungrown, young or old, strong, ample, fair, enduring, capable, rich, perennial with the earth, with freedom, law and love, a grand, sane, towering, seated mother, chaird in the adamant of time., i hear america singing, the varied carols i hear, those of mechanics, each one singing his as it should be blithe and strong, the carpenter singing his as he measures his plank or beam, the mason singing his as he makes ready for work, or leaves off work, the boatman singing what belongs to him in his boat, the deckhand singing on the steamboat deck, the shoemaker singing as he sits on his bench, the hatter singing as he stands, the wood-cutters song, the ploughboys on his way in the morning, or at noon intermission or at sundown, the delicious singing of the mother, or of the young wife at work, or of the girl sewing or washing, each singing what belongs to him or her and to none else, the day what belongs to the day”at night the party of young fellows, robust, friendly, singing with open mouths their strong melodious songs., o captain! my captain! our fearful trip is done, the ship has weatherd every rack, the prize we sought is won, the port is near, the bells i hear, the people all exulting, while follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring; but o heart! heart! heart! o the bleeding drops of red, where on the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead. o captain! my captain! rise up and hear the bells; rise up”for you the flag is flung”for you the bugle trills, for you bouquets and ribbond wreaths”for you the shores a-crowding, for you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning; here captain! dear father! this arm beneath your head! it is some dream that on the deck, youve fallen cold and dead. my captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still, my father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will, the ship is anchord safe and sound, its voyage closed and done, from fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won; exult o shores, and ring o bells! but i with mournful tread, walk the deck my captain lies, fallen cold and dead., as i ebbd with the ocean of life, as i wended the shores i know, as i walkd where the ripples continually wash you paumanok, where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant, where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways, i musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward, held by this electric self out of the pride of which i utter poems, was seizd by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot, the rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe. fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those slender windrows, chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten, scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide, miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me, paumanok there and then as i thought the old thought of likenesses, these you presented to me you fish-shaped island, as i wended the shores i know, as i walkd with that electric self seeking types. as i wend to the shores i know not, as i list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreckd, as i inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me, as the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer, i too but signify at the utmost a little washd-up drift, a few sands and dead leaves to gather, gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift. o baffled, balkd, bent to the very earth, oppressd with myself that i have dared to open my mouth, aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me i have not once had the least idea who or what i am, but that before all my arrogant poems the real me stands yet untouchd, untold, altogether unreachd, withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows, with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word i have written, pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath. i perceive i have not really understood any thing, not a single object, and that no man ever can, nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me, because i have dared to open my mouth to sing at all. you oceans both, i close with you, we murmur alike reproachfully rolling sands and drift, knowing not why, these little shreds indeed standing for you and me and all. you friable shore with trails of debris, you fish-shaped island, i take what is underfoot, what is yours is mine my father. i too paumanok, i too have bubbled up, floated the measureless float, and been washd on your shores, i too am but a trail of drift and debris, i too leave little wrecks upon you, you fish-shaped island. i throw myself upon your breast my father, i cling to you so that you cannot unloose me, i hold you so firm till you answer me something. kiss me my father, touch me with your lips as i touch those i love, breathe to me while i hold you close the secret of the murmuring i envy. ebb, ocean of life, (the flow will return,) cease not your moaning you fierce old mother, endlessly cry for your castaways, but fear not, deny not me, rustle not up so hoarse and angry against my feet as i touch you or gather from you. i mean tenderly by you and all, i gather for myself and for this phantom looking down where we lead, and following me and mine. me and mine, loose windrows, little corpses, froth, snowy white, and bubbles, (see, from my dead lips the ooze exuding at last, see, the prismatic colors glistening and rolling,) tufts of straw, sands, fragments, buoyd hither from many moods, one contradicting another, from the storm, the long calm, the darkness, the swell, musing, pondering, a breath, a briny tear, a dab of liquid or soil, up just as much out of fathomless workings fermented and thrown, a limp blossom or two, torn, just as much over waves floating, drifted at random, just as much for us that sobbing dirge of nature, just as much whence we come that blare of the cloud-trumpets, we, capricious, brought hither we know not whence, spread out before you, you up there walking or sitting, whoever you are, we too lie in drifts at your feet., out of the cradle endlessly rocking, out of the mocking-birds throat, the musical shuttle, out of the ninth-month midnight, over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wanderd alone, bareheaded, barefoot, down from the showerd halo, up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive, out from the patches of briers and blackberries, from the memories of the bird that chanted to me, from your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings i heard, from under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears, from those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist, from the thousand responses of my heart never to cease, from the myriad thence-arousd words, from the word stronger and more delicious than any, from such as now they start the scene revisiting, as a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing, borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly, a man, yet by these tears a little boy again, throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves, i, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter, taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them, a reminiscence sing. once paumanok, when the lilac-scent was in the air and fifth-month grass was growing, up this seashore in some briers, two featherd guests from alabama, two together, and their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown, and every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand, and every day the she-bird crouchd on her nest, silent, with bright eyes, and every day i, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them, cautiously peering, absorbing, translating. shine! shine! shine! pour down your warmth, great sun! while we bask, we two together. two together! winds blow south, or winds blow north, day come white, or night come black, home, or rivers and mountains from home, singing all time, minding no time, while we two keep together. till of a sudden, may-be killd, unknown to her mate, one forenoon the she-bird crouchd not on the nest, nor returnd that afternoon, nor the next, nor ever appeard again. and thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea, and at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather, over the hoarse surging of the sea, or flitting from brier to brier by day, i saw, i heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird, the solitary guest from alabama. blow! blow! blow! blow up sea-winds along paumanoks shore; i wait and i wait till you blow my mate to me. yes, when the stars glistend, all night long on the prong of a moss-scallopd stake, down almost amid the slapping waves, sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears. he calld on his mate, he pourd forth the meanings which i of all men know. yes my brother i know, the rest might not, but i have treasurd every note, for more than once dimly down to the beach gliding, silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows, recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts, the white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing, i, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair, listend long and long. listend to keep, to sing, now translating the notes, following you my brother. soothe! soothe! soothe! close on its wave soothes the wave behind, and again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close, but my love soothes not me, not me. low hangs the moon, it rose late, it is lagging”o i think it is heavy with love, with love. o madly the sea pushes upon the land, with love, with love. o night! do i not see my love fluttering out among the breakers? what is that little black thing i see there in the white? loud! loud! loud! loud i call to you, my love! high and clear i shoot my voice over the waves, surely you must know who is here, is here, you must know who i am, my love. low-hanging moon! what is that dusky spot in your brown yellow? o it is the shape, the shape of my mate! o moon do not keep her from me any longer. land! land! o land! whichever way i turn, o i think you could give me my mate back again if you only would, for i am almost sure i see her dimly whichever way i look. o rising stars! perhaps the one i want so much will rise, will rise with some of you. o throat! o trembling throat! sound clearer through the atmosphere! pierce the woods, the earth, somewhere listening to catch you must be the one i want. shake out carols! solitary here, the nights carols! carols of lonesome love! deaths carols! carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon! o under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea! o reckless despairing carols. but soft! sink low! soft! let me just murmur, and do you wait a moment you husky-noisd sea, for somewhere i believe i heard my mate responding to me, so faint, i must be still, be still to listen, but not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me. hither my love! here i am! here! with this just-sustaind note i announce myself to you, this gentle call is for you my love, for you. do not be decoyd elsewhere, that is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice, that is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray, those are the shadows of leaves. o darkness! o in vain! o i am very sick and sorrowful. o brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea! o troubled reflection in the sea! o throat! o throbbing heart! and i singing uselessly, uselessly all the night. o past! o happy life! o songs of joy! in the air, in the woods, over fields, loved! loved! loved! loved! loved! but my mate no more, no more with me! we two together no more. the aria sinking, all else continuing, the stars shining, the winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing, with angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning, on the sands of paumanoks shore gray and rustling, the yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching, the boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying, the love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting, the arias meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing, the strange tears down the cheeks coursing, the colloquy there, the trio, each uttering, the undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying, to the boys souls questions sullenly timing, some drownd secret hissing, to the outsetting bard. demon or bird! (said the boys soul,) is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me? for i, that was a child, my tongues use sleeping, now i have heard you, now in a moment i know what i am for, i awake, and already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours, a thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die. o you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me, o solitary me listening, never more shall i cease perpetuating you, never more shall i escape, never more the reverberations, never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me, never again leave me to be the peaceful child i was before what there in the night, by the sea under the yellow and sagging moon, the messenger there arousd, the fire, the sweet hell within, the unknown want, the destiny of me. o give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,) o if i am to have so much, let me have more! a word then, (for i will conquer it,) the word final, superior to all, subtle, sent up”what is it?”i listen; are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves? is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands? whereto answering, the sea, delaying not, hurrying not, whisperd me through the night, and very plainly before day-break, lispd to me the low and delicious word death, and again death, death, death, death, hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arousd childs heart, but edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet, creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over, death, death, death, death, death. which i do not forget, but fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother, that he sang to me in the moonlight on paumanoks gray beach, with the thousand responsive songs at random, my own songs awaked from that hour, and with them the key, the word up from the waves, the word of the sweetest song and all songs, that strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet, (or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,) the sea whisperd me., i felt a funeral, in my brain, and mourners to and fro kept treading - treading - till it seemed that sense was breaking through - and when they all were seated, a service, like a drum - kept beating - beating - till i thought my mind was going numb - and then i heard them lift a box and creak across my soul with those same boots of lead, again, then space - began to toll, as all the heavens were a bell, and being, but an ear, and i, and silence, some strange race, wrecked, solitary, here - and then a plank in reason, broke, and i dropped down, and down - and hit a world, at every plunge, and finished knowing - then -, it was not death, for i stood up, and all the dead, lie down - it was not night, for all the bells put out their tongues, for noon. it was not frost, for on my flesh i felt siroccos - crawl - nor fire - for just my marble feet could keep a chancel, cool - and yet, it tasted, like them all, the figures i have seen set orderly, for burial reminded me, of mine - as if my life were shaven, and fitted to a frame, and could not breathe without a key, and twas like midnight, some - when everything that ticked - has stopped - and space stares - all around - or grisly frosts - first autumn morns, repeal the beating ground - but most, like chaos - stopless - cool - without a chance, or spar - or even a report of land - to justify - despair., because i could not stop for death “ he kindly stopped for me “ the carriage held but just ourselves “ and immortality. we slowly drove “ he knew no haste and i had put away my labor and my leisure too, for his civility “ we passed the school, where children strove at recess “ in the ring “ we passed the fields of gazing grain “ we passed the setting sun “ or rather “ he passed us “ the dews drew quivering and chill “ for only gossamer, my gown “ my tippet “ only tulle “ we paused before a house that seemed a swelling of the ground “ the roof was scarcely visible “ the cornice “ in the ground “ since then “ 'tis centuries “ and yet feels shorter than the day i first surmised the horses' heads were toward eternity “, i never hear that one is dead without the chance of life afresh annihilating me that mightiest belief, too mighty for the daily mind that tilling its abyss, had madness, had it once or, twice the yawning consciousness, beliefs are bandaged, like the tongue when terror were it told in any tone commensurate would strike us instant dead - i do not know the man so bold he dare in lonely place that awful stranger - consciousness deliberately face -, hear the voice of the bard! who present, past, & future sees whose ears have heard, the holy word, that walk'd among the ancient trees. calling the lapsed soul and weeping in the evening dew: that might controll, the starry pole; and fallen fallen light renew! o earth o earth return! arise from out the dewy grass; night is worn, and the morn rises from the slumberous mass. turn away no more: why wilt thou turn away the starry floor the watry shore is giv'n thee till the break of day., piping down the valleys wild piping songs of pleasant glee on a cloud i saw a child. and he laughing said to me. pipe a song about a lamb; so i piped with merry chear, piper pipe that song again” so i piped, he wept to hear. drop thy pipe thy happy pipe sing thy songs of happy chear, so i sung the same again while he wept with joy to hear piper sit thee down and write in a book that all may read” so he vanish'd from my sight. and i pluck'd a hollow reed. and i made a rural pen, and i stain'd the water clear, and i wrote my happy songs every child may joy to hear, there is a smile of love and there is a smile of deceit and there is a smile of smiles in which these two smiles meet and there is a frown of hate and there is a frown of disdain and there is a frown of frowns which you strive to forget in vain for it sticks in the hearts deep core and it sticks in the deep back bone and no smile that ever was smild but only one smile alone that betwixt the cradle & grave it only once smild can be but when it once is smild theres an end to all misery, 1. i watched thee when the foe was at our side, ready to strike at him”or thee and me, were safety hopeless”rather than divide aught with one loved save love and liberty. 2. i watched thee on the breakers, when the rock, received our prow, and all was storm and fear, and bade thee cling to me through every shock; this arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier. 3. i watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes, yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground when overworn with watching, neer to rise from thence if thou an early grave hadst found. 4. the earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall, and men and nature reeled as if with wine. whom did i seek around the tottering hall? for thee. whose safety first provide for? thine. 5. and when convulsive throes denied my breath the faintest utterance to my fading thought, to thee”to thee”een in the gasp of death my spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought. 6. thus much and more; and yet thou lovst me not, and never wilt! love dwells not in our will. nor can i blame thee, though it be my lot to strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still., she walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies; and all thats best of dark and bright meet in her aspect and her eyes; thus mellowed to that tender light which heaven to gaudy day denies. one shade the more, one ray the less, had half impaired the nameless grace which waves in every raven tress, or softly lightens oer her face; where thoughts serenely sweet express, how pure, how dear their dwelling-place. and on that cheek, and oer that brow, so soft, so calm, yet eloquent, the smiles that win, the tints that glow, but tell of days in goodness spent, a mind at peace with all below, a heart whose love is innocent!, i had a dream, which was not all a dream. the bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars did wander darkling in the eternal space, rayless, and pathless, and the icy earth swung blind and blackening in the moonless air; morn came and went”and came, and brought no day, and men forgot their passions in the dread of this their desolation; and all hearts were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light: and they did live by watchfires”and the thrones, the palaces of crowned kings”the huts, the habitations of all things which dwell, were burnt for beacons; cities were consum'd, and men were gather'd round their blazing homes to look once more into each other's face; happy were those who dwelt within the eye of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch: a fearful hope was all the world contain'd; forests were set on fire”but hour by hour they fell and faded”and the crackling trunks extinguish'd with a crash”and all was black. the brows of men by the despairing light wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits the flashes fell upon them; some lay down and hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest their chins upon their clenched hands, and smil'd; and others hurried to and fro, and fed their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up with mad disquietude on the dull sky, the pall of a past world; and then again with curses cast them down upon the dust, and gnash'd their teeth and howl'd: the wild birds shriek'd and, terrified, did flutter on the ground, and flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawl'd and twin'd themselves among the multitude, hissing, but stingless”they were slain for food. and war, which for a moment was no more, did glut himself again: a meal was bought with blood, and each sate sullenly apart gorging himself in gloom: no love was left; all earth was but one thought”and that was death immediate and inglorious; and the pang of famine fed upon all entrails”men died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh; the meagre by the meagre were devour'd, even dogs assail'd their masters, all save one, and he was faithful to a corse, and kept the birds and beasts and famish'd men at bay, till hunger clung them, or the dropping dead lur'd their lank jaws; himself sought out no food, but with a piteous and perpetual moan, and a quick desolate cry, licking the hand which answer'd not with a caress”he died. the crowd was famish'd by degrees; but two of an enormous city did survive, and they were enemies: they met beside the dying embers of an altar-place where had been heap'd a mass of holy things for an unholy usage; they rak'd up, and shivering scrap'd with their cold skeleton hands the feeble ashes, and their feeble breath blew for a little life, and made a flame which was a mockery; then they lifted up their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld each other's aspects”saw, and shriek'd, and died” even of their mutual hideousness they died, unknowing who he was upon whose brow famine had written fiend. the world was void, the populous and the powerful was a lump, seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless” a lump of death”a chaos of hard clay. the rivers, lakes and ocean all stood still, and nothing stirr'd within their silent depths; ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, and their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropp'd they slept on the abyss without a surge” the waves were dead; the tides were in their grave, the moon, their mistress, had expir'd before; the winds were wither'd in the stagnant air, and the clouds perish'd; darkness had no need of aid from them”she was the universe., dear doctor, i have read your play, which is a good one in its way, purges the eyes, and moves the bowels, and drenches handkerchiefs like towels with tears that, in a flux of grief, afford hysterical relief to shatter'd nerves and quicken'd pulses, which your catastrophe convulses. i like your moral and machinery; your plot, too, has such scope for scenery! your dialogue is apt and smart; the play's concoction full of art; your hero raves, your heroine cries, all stab, and everybody dies; in short, your tragedy would be the very thing to hear and see; and for a piece of publication, if i decline on this occasion, it is not that i am not sensible to merits in themselves ostensible, but”and i grieve to speak it”plays are drugs”mere drugs, sir, nowadays. i had a heavy loss by manuel ” too lucky if it prove not annual” and sotheby, with his damn'd orestes (which, by the way, the old bore's best is), has lain so very long on hand that i despair of all demand; i've advertis'd”but see my books, or only watch my shopman's looks; still ivan, ina and such lumber my back-shop glut, my shelves encumber. there's byron too, who once did better, has sent me”folded in a letter” a sort of”it's no more a drama than darnley, ivan or kehama: so alter'd since last year his pen is, i think he's lost his wits at venice, or drain'd his brains away as stallion to some dark-eyed and warm italian; in short, sir, what with one and t'other, i dare not venture on another. i write in haste; excuse each blunder; the coaches through the street so thunder! my room's so full; we've gifford here reading mss with hookham frere, pronouncing on the nouns and particles of some of our forthcoming articles, the quarterly”ah, sir, if you had but the genius to review! a smart critique upon st. helena, or if you only would but tell in a short compass what”but, to resume; as i was saying, sir, the room” the room's so full of wits and bards, crabbes, campbells, crokers, freres and wards, and others, neither bards nor wits” my humble tenement admits all persons in the dress of gent., from mr. hammond to dog dent. a party dines with me today, all clever men who make their way: crabbe, malcolm, hamilton and chantrey are all partakers of my pantry. they're at this moment in discussion on poor de staã«l's late dissolution. her book, they say, was in advance” pray heaven she tell the truth of france! 'tis said she certainly was married to rocca, and had twice miscarried, no”not miscarried, i opine” but brought to bed at forty nine. some say she died a papist; some are of opinion that's a hum; i don't know that”the fellow, schlegel, was very likely to inveigle a dying person in compunction to try the extremity of unction. but peace be with her! for a woman her talents surely were uncommon. her publisher (and public too) the hour of her demise may rue, for never more within his shop he” pray”was she not interr'd at coppet? thus run our time and tongues away; but, to return, sir, to your play; sorry, sir, but i cannot deal, unless 'twere acted by o'neill. my hands are full”my head so busy, i'm almost dead”and always dizzy; and so, with endless truth and hurry, dear doctor, i am yours, john murray, the palm at the end of the mind, beyond the last thought, rises in the bronze decor, a gold-feathered bird sings in the palm, without human meaning, without human feeling, a foreign song. you know then that it is not the reason that makes us happy or unhappy. the bird sings. its feathers shine. the palm stands on the edge of space. the wind moves slowly in the branches. the bird's fire-fangled feathers dangle down., one must have a mind of winter to regard the frost and the boughs of the pine-trees crusted with snow; and have been cold a long time to behold the junipers shagged with ice, the spruces rough in the distant glitter of the january sun; and not to think of any misery in the sound of the wind, in the sound of a few leaves, which is the sound of the land full of the same wind that is blowing in the same bare place for the listener, who listens in the snow, and, nothing himself, beholds nothing that is not there and the nothing that is., she sang beyond the genius of the sea. the water never formed to mind or voice, like a body wholly body, fluttering its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion made constant cry, caused constantly a cry, that was not ours although we understood, inhuman, of the veritable ocean. the sea was not a mask. no more was she. the song and water were not medleyed sound even if what she sang was what she heard, since what she sang was uttered word by word. it may be that in all her phrases stirred the grinding water and the gasping wind; but it was she and not the sea we heard. for she was the maker of the song she sang. the ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea was merely a place by which she walked to sing. whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew it was the spirit that we sought and knew that we should ask this often as she sang. if it was only the dark voice of the sea that rose, or even colored by many waves; if it was only the outer voice of sky and cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled, however clear, it would have been deep air, the heaving speech of air, a summer sound repeated in a summer without end and sound alone. but it was more than that, more even than her voice, and ours, among the meaningless plungings of water and the wind, theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped on high horizons, mountainous atmospheres of sky and sea. it was her voice that made the sky acutest at its vanishing. she measured to the hour its solitude. she was the single artificer of the world in which she sang. and when she sang, the sea, whatever self it had, became the self that was her song, for she was the maker. then we, as we beheld her striding there alone, knew that there never was a world for her except the one she sang and, singing, made. ramon fernandez, tell me, if you know, why, when the singing ended and we turned toward the town, tell why the glassy lights, the lights in the fishing boats at anchor there, as the night descended, tilting in the air, mastered the night and portioned out the sea, fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles, arranging, deepening, enchanting night. oh! blessed rage for order, pale ramon, the makers rage to order words of the sea, words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred, and of ourselves and of our origins, in ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds., the poem of the mind in the act of finding what will suffice. it has not always had to find: the scene was set; it repeated what was in the script. then the theatre was changed to something else. its past was a souvenir. it has to be living, to learn the speech of the place. it has to face the men of the time and to meet the women of the time. it has to think about war and it has to find what will suffice. it has to construct a new stage. it has to be on that stage and, like an insatiable actor, slowly and with meditation, speak words that in the ear, in the delicatest ear of the mind, repeat, exactly, that which it wants to hear, at the sound of which, an invisible audience listens, not to the play, but to itself, expressed in an emotion as of two people, as of two emotions becoming one. the actor is a metaphysician in the dark, twanging an instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly containing the mind, below which it cannot descend, beyond which it has no will to rise. it must be the finding of a satisfaction, and may be of a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman combing. the poem of the act of the mind., thou hast committed ” fornication: but that was in another country, and besides, the wench is dead. (the jew of malta) i among the smoke and fog of a december afternoon you have the scene arrange itself ” as it will seem to do” with \"i have saved this afternoon for you\"; and four wax candles in the darkened room, four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead, an atmosphere of juliet's tomb prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid. we have been, let us say, to hear the latest pole transmit the preludes, through his hair and finger-tips. \"so intimate, this chopin, that i think his soul should be resurrected only among friends some two or three, who will not touch the bloom that is rubbed and questioned in the concert room.\" ”and so the conversation slips among velleities and carefully caught regrets through attenuated tones of violins mingled with remote cornets and begins. \"you do not know how much they mean to me, my friends, and how, how rare and strange it is, to find in a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends, (for indeed i do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind! how keen you are!) to find a friend who has these qualities, who has, and gives those qualities upon which friendship lives. how much it means that i say this to you ” without these friendships ” life, what cauchemar!\" among the winding of the violins and the ariettes of cracked cornets inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins absurdly hammering a prelude of its own, capricious monotone that is at least one definite \"false note.\" ” let us take the air, in a tobacco trance, admire the monuments, discuss the late events, correct our watches by the public clocks. then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks. ii now that lilacs are in bloom she has a bowl of lilacs in her room and twists one in her fingers while she talks. \"ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know what life is, you who hold it in your hands\"; (slowly twisting the lilac stalks) \"you let it flow from you, you let it flow, and youth is cruel, and has no remorse and smiles at situations which it cannot see.\" i smile, of course, and go on drinking tea. \"yet with these april sunsets, that somehow recall my buried life, and paris in the spring, i feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world to be wonderful and youthful, after all.\" the voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune of a broken violin on an august afternoon: \"i am always sure that you understand my feelings, always sure that you feel, sure that across the gulf you reach your hand. you are invulnerable, you have no achilles' heel. you will go on, and when you have prevailed you can say: at this point many a one has failed. but what have i, but what have i, my friend, to give you, what can you receive from me? only the friendship and the sympathy of one about to reach her journey's end. i shall sit here, serving tea to friends ....\" i take my hat: how can i make a cowardly amends for what she has said to me? you will see me any morning in the park reading the comics and the sporting page. particularly i remark. an english countess goes upon the stage. a greek was murdered at a polish dance, another bank defaulter has confessed. i keep my countenance, i remain self-possessed except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired reiterates some worn-out common song with the smell of hyacinths across the garden recalling things that other people have desired. are these ideas right or wrong? iii the october night comes down; returning as before except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease i mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door and feel as if i had mounted on my hands and knees. \"and so you are going abroad; and when do you return? but that's a useless question. you hardly know when you are coming back, you will find so much to learn.\" my smile falls heavily among the bric-ã -brac. \"perhaps you can write to me.\" my self-possession flares up for a second; this is as i had reckoned. \"i have been wondering frequently of late (but our beginnings never know our ends!) why we have not developed into friends.\" i feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark suddenly, his expression in a glass. my self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. \"for everybody said so, all our friends, they all were sure our feelings would relate so closely! i myself can hardly understand. we must leave it now to fate. you will write, at any rate. perhaps it is not too late. i shall sit here, serving tea to friends.\" and i must borrow every changing shape to find expression ... dance, dance like a dancing bear, cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape. let us take the air, in a tobacco trance” well! and what if she should die some afternoon, afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose; should die and leave me sitting pen in hand with the smoke coming down above the housetops; doubtful, for quite a while not knowing what to feel or if i understand or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ... would she not have the advantage, after all? this music is successful with a \"dying fall\" now that we talk of dying” and should i have the right to smile?, apeneck sweeney spread his knees letting his arms hang down to laugh, the zebra stripes along his jaw swelling to maculate giraffe. the circles of the stormy moon slide westward toward the river plate, death and the raven drift above and sweeney guards the hornã¨d gate. gloomy orion and the dog are veiled; and hushed the shrunken seas; the person in the spanish cape tries to sit on sweeneys knees slips and pulls the table cloth overturns a coffee-cup, reorganised upon the floor she yawns and draws a stocking up; the silent man in mocha brown sprawls at the window-sill and gapes; the waiter brings in oranges bananas figs and hothouse grapes; the silent vertebrate in brown contracts and concentrates, withdraws; rachel nã©e rabinovitch tears at the grapes with murderous paws; she and the lady in the cape are suspect, thought to be in league; therefore the man with heavy eyes declines the gambit, shows fatigue, leaves the room and reappears outside the window, leaning in, branches of wistaria circumscribe a golden grin; the host with someone indistinct converses at the door apart, the nightingales are singing near the convent of the sacred heart, and sang within the bloody wood when agamemnon cried aloud and let their liquid siftings fall to stain the stiff dishonoured shroud., if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too; if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, dont deal in lies, or being hated, dont give way to hating, and yet dont look too good, nor talk too wise: if you can dream”and not make dreams your master; if you can think”and not make thoughts your aim; if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same; if you can bear to hear the truth youve spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build em up with worn-out tools: if you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss; if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them: ˜hold on! if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings”nor lose the common touch, if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much; if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of

but who shall return us the children? at the hour the barbarian chose to disclose his pretences, and raged against man, they engaged, on the breasts that they bared for us, the first felon-stroke of the sword he had long-time prepared for us” their bodies were all our defence while we wrought our defences. they bought us anew with their blood, forbearing to blame us, those hours which we had not made good when the judgment oercame us. they believed us and perished for it. our statecraft, our learning delivered them bound to the pit and alive to the burning whither they mirthfully hastened as jostling for honour” nor since her birth has our earth seen such worth loosed upon her. nor was their agony brief, or once only imposed on them. the wounded, the war-spent, the sick received no

night. only ourselves remain to face the naked days in silent fortitude, through perils and dismays renewed and re-renewed. though all we made depart, the old commandments stand:” \"in patience keep

briefness life: handorgans and april darkness,friends i charge laughing. into the hair-thin tints of yellow dawn, into the women-coloured twilight i smilingly glide. i into the big vermilion departure swim,sayingly; (do you think?)the i do,world is probably made of roses & hello: (of solongs and,ashes), i i saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix, angelheaded hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night, who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz, who bared their brains to heaven under the el and saw mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated, who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating arkansas and blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war, who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull, who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the terror through the wall, who got busted in their pubic beards returning through laredo with a belt of marijuana for new york, who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in paradise alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls, incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of canada & paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of time between, peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind, who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from battery to holy bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of zoo, who sank all night in submarine light of bickfords floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate fugazzis, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox, who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to bellevue to museum to the brooklyn bridge, a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off empire state out of the moon, yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars, whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the synagogue cast on the pavement, who vanished into nowhere zen new jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of atlantic city hall, suffering eastern sweats and tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of china under junk-withdrawal in newarks bleak furnished room, who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts, who lit cigarettes in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night, who studied plotinus poe st. john of the cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in kansas, who loned it through the streets of idaho seeking visionary indian angels who were visionary indian angels, who thought they were only mad when baltimore gleamed in supernatural ecstasy, who jumped in limousines with the chinaman of oklahoma on the impulse of winter midnight streetlight smalltown rain, who lounged hungry and lonesome through houston seeking jazz or sex or soup, and followed the brilliant spaniard to converse about america and eternity, a hopeless task, and so took ship to africa, who disappeared into the volcanoes of mexico leaving behind nothing but the shadow of dungarees and the lava and ash of poetry scattered in fireplace chicago, who reappeared on the west coast investigating the fbi in beards and shorts with big pacifist eyes sexy in their dark skin passing out incomprehensible leaflets, who burned cigarette holes in their arms protesting the narcotic tobacco haze of capitalism, who distributed supercommunist pamphlets in union square weeping and undressing while the sirens of los alamos wailed them down, and wailed down wall, and the staten island ferry also wailed, who broke down crying in white gymnasiums naked and trembling before the machinery of other skeletons, who bit detectives in the neck and shrieked with delight in policecars for committing no crime but their own wild cooking pederasty and intoxication, who howled on their knees in the subway and were dragged off the roof waving genitals and manuscripts, who let themselves be fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists, and screamed with joy, who blew and were blown by those human seraphim, the sailors, caresses of atlantic and caribbean love, who balled in the morning in the evenings in rosegardens and the grass of public parks and cemeteries scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may, who hiccuped endlessly trying to giggle but wound up with a sob behind a partition in a turkish bath when the blond & naked angel came to pierce them with a sword, who lost their loveboys to the three old shrews of fate the one eyed shrew of the heterosexual dollar the one eyed shrew that winks out of the womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsmans loom, who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness, who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake, who went out whoring through colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, n.c., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and adonis of denver”joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings & especially secret gas-station solipsisms of johns, & hometown alleys too, who faded out in vast sordid movies, were shifted in dreams, woke on a sudden manhattan, and picked themselves up out of basements hung-over with heartless tokay and horrors of third avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices, who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the east river to open to a room full of steam-heat and opium, who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion, who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of bowery, who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music, who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts, who coughed on the sixth floor of harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology, who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which in the yellow morning were stanzas of gibberish, who cooked rotten animals lung heart feet tail borsht & tortillas dreaming of the pure vegetable kingdom, who plunged themselves under meat trucks looking for an egg, who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for eternity outside of time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade, who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried, who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on madison avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of absolute reality, who jumped off the brooklyn bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer, who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic european 1930s german jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles, who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each others hotrod-golgotha jail-solitude watch or birmingham jazz incarnation, who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if i had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out eternity, who journeyed to denver, who died in denver, who came back to denver & waited in vain, who watched over denver & brooded & loned in denver and finally went away to find out the time, & now denver is lonesome for her heroes, who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each others salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second, who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to alcatraz, who retired to mexico to cultivate a habit, or rocky mount to tender buddha or tangiers to boys or southern pacific to the black locomotive or harvard to narcissus to woodlawn to the daisychain or grave, who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury, who threw potato salad at ccny lecturers on dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy, and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong & amnesia, who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia, returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the east, pilgrim states rocklands and greystones foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon, with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 a.m. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination” ah, carl, while you are not safe i am not safe, and now youre really in the total animal soup of time” and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane, who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in time & space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun and dash of consciousness together jumping with sensation of pater omnipotens aeterna deus to recreate the syntax and measure of poor human prose and stand before you speechless and intelligent and shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head, the madman bum and angel beat in time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death, and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of americas naked mind for love into an eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio with the absolute heart of the poem of life butchered out of their own bodies good to

are red i go up on top of the rca building and gaze at my world, manhattan” my buildings, streets ive done feats in, lofts, beds, coldwater flats ”on fifth ave below which i also bear in mind, its ant cars, little yellow taxis, men walking the size of specks of wool” panorama of the bridges, sunrise over brooklyn machine, sun go down over new jersey where i was born & paterson where i played with ants” my later loves on 15th street, my greater loves of lower east side, my once fabulous amours in the bronx faraway” paths crossing in these hidden streets, my history summed up, my absences and ecstasies in harlem” ”sun shining down on all i own in one eyeblink to the horizon in my last eternity” matter is water. sad, i take the elevator and go down, pondering, and walk on the pavements staring into all mans plateglass, faces, questioning after who loves, and stop, bemused in front of an automobile shopwindow standing lost in calm thought, traffic moving up & down 5th avenue blocks behind me waiting for a moment when ... time to go home & cook supper & listen to the romantic war news on the radio ... all movement stops & i walk in the timeless sadness of existence, tenderness flowing thru the buildings, my fingertips touching realitys face, my own face streaked with tears in the mirror of some window”at dusk” where i have no desire” for bonbons”or to own the dresses or japanese lampshades of intellection” confused by the spectacle around me, man struggling up the street with packages, newspapers, ties, beautiful suits toward his desire man, woman, streaming over the pavements red lights clocking hurried watches & movements at the curb” and all these streets leading so crosswise, honking, lengthily, by avenues stalked by high buildings or crusted into slums thru such halting traffic screaming cars and engines so painfully to this countryside, this graveyard this stillness on deathbed or mountain once seen never regained or desired in the mind to come where all manhattan that ive seen must disappear., i walked on the banks of the tincan banana dock and sat down under the huge shade of a southern pacific locomotive to look at the sunset over the box house hills and cry. jack kerouac sat beside me on a busted rusty iron pole, companion, we thought the same thoughts of the soul, bleak and blue and sad-eyed, surrounded by the gnarled steel roots of trees of machinery. the oily water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top of final frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily. look at the sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust” ”i rushed up enchanted”it was my first sunflower, memories of blake”my visions”harlem and hells of the eastern rivers, bridges clanking joes greasy sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms & pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past” and the gray sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye” corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like a dried wire spiderweb, leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear, unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower o my soul, i loved you then! the grime was no mans grime but death and human locomotives, all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black misry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt”industrial”modern”all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown” and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could i name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs & sphincters of dynamos”all these entangled in your mummied roots”and you there standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form! a perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly breeze! how many flies buzzed round you innocent of your grime, while you cursed the heavens of the railroad and your flower soul? poor dead flower? when did you forget you were a flower? when did you look at your skin and decide you were an impotent dirty old locomotive? the ghost of a locomotive? the specter and shade of a once powerful mad american locomotive? you were never no locomotive, sunflower, you were a sunflower! and you locomotive, you are a locomotive, forget me not! so i grabbed up the skeleton thick sunflower and stuck it at my side like a scepter, and deliver my sermon to my soul, and jacks soul too, and anyone wholl listen, ”were not our skin of grime, were not dread bleak dusty imageless locomotives, were golden sunflowers inside, blessed by our own seed & hairy naked accomplishment-bodies growing into mad black formal sunflowers in the sunset, spied on by our own eyes under the shadow of the mad locomotive riverbank sunset frisco hilly tincan evening sitdown vision., america ive given you all and now im nothing. america two dollars and twentyseven cents january 17, 1956. i cant stand my own mind. america when will we end the human war? go fuck yourself with your atom bomb. i dont feel good dont bother me. i wont write my poem till im in my right mind. america when will you be angelic?

will you send your eggs to india? im sick of your insane demands. when can i go into the supermarket and buy what i need with my good looks? america after all it is you and i who are perfect not the next world. your machinery is too much for me. you made me want to be a saint. there must be some other way to settle this argument. burroughs is in tangiers i dont think hell come back its sinister. are you being sinister or is this some form of practical joke? im trying to come to the point. i refuse to give up my obsession. america stop pushing i know what im doing. america the plum blossoms

still havent told you what you did to uncle max after he came over from russia. im addressing you. are you going to let your emotional life be run by time magazine? im obsessed by time magazine. i read it every week. its cover stares at me every time i slink past the corner candystore. i read it in the basement of the berkeley public library. its always telling me about responsibility. businessmen are serious. movie producers are serious. everybodys serious but me. it occurs to me that i am america. i am talking to myself again. asia is rising against me. i havent got a chinamans chance. id better consider my national resources. my national resources consist of two joints of marijuana millions of genitals an unpublishable private literature that jetplanes 1400 miles an hour and twentyfive-thousand mental institutions. i say nothing about my prisons nor the millions of underprivileged who live in my flowerpots under the light of five hundred suns. i have abolished the whorehouses of france, tangiers is the next to go. my ambition is to be president despite the fact that im a catholic. america how can i write a holy litany in your silly mood? i will continue like

america save the spanish loyalists america sacco & vanzetti must not die america i am the scottsboro boys. america when i was seven momma took me to communist cell meetings they sold us garbanzos a

anyway. america im putting my queer shoulder to the wheel., pure? what does it mean? the tongues of hell are dull, dull as the triple tongues of dull, fat cerberus who wheezes at the gate. incapable of licking clean the aguey tendon, the sin, the sin. the tinder cries. the indelible smell of a snuffed candle! love, love, the low smokes roll from me like isadoras scarves, im in a fright one scarf will catch and anchor in the wheel, such yellow sullen smokes make their own element. they will not rise, but trundle round the globe choking the aged and the meek, the weak hothouse baby in its crib, the ghastly orchid hanging its hanging garden in the air, devilish leopard! radiation turned it white and killed it in an hour. greasing the bodies of adulterers like hiroshima ash and eating in. the sin. the sin. darling, all night i have been flickering, off, on, off, on. the sheets grow heavy as a lechers kiss. three days. three nights. lemon water, chicken water, water make me retch. i am too pure for you or anyone. your body hurts me as the world hurts god. i am a lantern”” my head a moon of japanese paper, my gold beaten skin infinitely delicate and infinitely expensive. does not my heat astound you! and my light! all by myself i am a huge camellia glowing and coming and going, flush on flush. i think i am going up, i think i may rise”” the beads of hot metal fly, and i love, i am a pure acetylene virgin attended by roses, by kisses, by cherubim, by whatever these pink things mean! not you, nor him nor him, nor him (my selves dissolving, old whore petticoats)”” to paradise., stasis in darkness. then the substanceless blue pour of tor and distances. gods lioness, how one we grow, pivot of heels and knees!”the furrow splits and passes, sister to the brown arc of the neck i cannot catch, nigger-eye berries cast dark hooks” black sweet blood mouthfuls, shadows. something else hauls me through air” thighs, hair; flakes from my heels. white godiva, i unpeel” dead hands, dead stringencies. and now i foam to wheat, a glitter of seas. the childs cry melts in the wall. and i am the arrow, the dew that flies suicidal, at one with the drive into the red eye, the cauldron of morning., the woman is perfected. her dead body wears the smile of accomplishment, the illusion of a greek necessity flows in the scrolls of her toga, her bare feet seem to be saying: we have come so far, it is over. each dead child coiled, a white serpent, one at each little pitcher of milk, now empty. she has folded them back into her body as petals of a rose close when the garden stiffens and odors bleed from the sweet, deep throats of the night flower. the moon has nothing to be sad about, staring from her hood of bone. she is used to this sort of thing. her blacks crackle and drag., love set you going like a fat gold watch. the midwife slapped your footsoles, and your bald cry took its place among the elements. our voices echo, magnifying your arrival. new statue. in a drafty museum, your nakedness shadows our safety. we stand round blankly as walls. im no more your mother than the cloud that distills a mirror to reflect its own slow effacement at the winds hand. all night your moth-breath flickers among the flat pink roses. i wake to listen: a far sea moves in my ear. one cry, and i stumble from bed, cow-heavy and floral in my victorian nightgown. your mouth opens clean as a cats. the window square whitens and swallows its dull stars. and now you try your handful of notes; the clear vowels rise like balloons., i shall never get you put together entirely, pieced, glued, and properly jointed. mule-bray, pig-grunt and bawdy cackles proceed from your great lips. its worse than a barnyard. perhaps you consider yourself an oracle, mouthpiece of the dead, or of some god or other. thirty years now i have labored to dredge the silt from your throat. i am none the wiser. scaling little ladders with glue pots and pails of lysol i crawl like an ant in mourning over the weedy acres of your brow to mend the immense skull plates and clear the bald, white tumuli of your eyes. a blue sky out of the oresteia arches above us. o father, all by yourself you are pithy and historical as the roman forum. i open my lunch on a hill of black cypress. your fluted bones and acanthine hair are littered in their old anarchy to the horizon-line. it would take more than a lightning-stroke to create such a ruin. nights, i squat in the cornucopia of your left ear, out of the wind, counting the red stars and those of plum-color. the sun rises under the pillar of your tongue. my hours are married to shadow. no longer do i listen for the scrape of a keel on the blank stones of the landing., a free bird leaps on the back of the wind and floats downstream till the current ends and dips his wing in the orange sun rays and dares to claim the sky. but a bird that stalks down his narrow cage can seldom see through his bars of rage his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom. the free bird thinks of another breeze and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees and the fat worms waiting on a dawn bright lawn and he names the sky his own but a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing. the caged bird sings with a fearful trill of things unknown but longed for still and his tune is heard on the distant hill for the caged bird sings of freedom., you may write me down in history with your bitter, twisted lies, you may trod me in the very dirt but still, like dust, i'll rise. does my sassiness upset you? why are you beset with gloom? cause i walk like i've got oil wells pumping in my living room. just like moons and like suns, with the certainty of tides, just like hopes springing high, still i'll rise. did you want to see me broken? bowed head and lowered eyes? shoulders falling down like teardrops, weakened by my soulful cries? does my haughtiness offend you? don't you take it awful hard cause i laugh like i've got gold mines diggin in my own backyard. you may shoot me with your words, you may cut me with your eyes, you may kill me with your hatefulness, but still, like air, ill rise. does my sexiness upset you? does it come as a surprise that i dance like i've got diamonds at the meeting of my thighs? out of the huts of historys shame i rise up from a past thats rooted in pain i rise i'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, welling and swelling i bear in the tide. leaving behind nights of terror and fear i rise into a daybreak thats wondrously clear i rise bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave, i am the dream and the hope of the slave. i rise i rise i rise., she came home running back to the mothering blackness deep in the smothering blackness white tears icicle gold plains of her face she came home running she came down creeping here to the black arms waiting now to the warm heart waiting rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face she came down creeping she came home blameless black yet as hagars daughter tall as was shebas daughter threats of northern winds die on the deserts face she came home blameless, pretty women wonder where my secret lies. im not cute or built to suit a fashion models size but when i start to tell them, they think im telling lies. i say, its in the reach of my arms, the span of my hips, the stride of my step, the curl of my lips. im a woman phenomenally. phenomenal woman, thats me. i walk into a room just as cool as you please, and to a man, the fellows stand or fall down on their knees. then they swarm around me, a hive of honey bees. i say, its the fire in my eyes, and the flash of my teeth, the swing in my waist, and the joy in my feet. im a woman phenomenally. phenomenal woman, thats me. men themselves have wondered what they see in me. they try so much but they cant touch my inner mystery. when i try to show them, they say they still cant see. i say, its in the arch of my back, the sun of my smile, the ride of my breasts, the grace of my style. im a woman phenomenally. phenomenal woman, thats me. now you understand just why my heads not bowed. i dont shout or jump about or have to talk real loud. when you see me passing, it ought to make you proud. i say, its in the click of my heels, the bend of my hair, the palm of my hand, the need for my care. cause im a woman phenomenally. phenomenal woman, thats me., now when i walk around at lunchtime i have only two charms in my pocket an old roman coin mike kanemitsu gave me and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case when i was in madrid the others never brought me too much luck though they did help keep me in new york against coercion but now i'm happy for a time and interested i walk through the luminous humidity passing the house of seagram with its wet and its loungers and the construction to the left that closed the sidewalk if i ever get to be a construction worker i'd like to have a silver hat please and get to moriarty's where i wait for leroi and hear who wants to be a mover and shaker the last five years my batting average is .016 that's that, and leroi comes in and tells me miles davis was clubbed 12 times last night outside birdland by a cop a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible disease but we don't give her one we don't like terrible diseases, then we go eat some fish and some ale it's cool but crowded we don't like lionel trilling we decide, we like don allen we don't like henry james so much we like herman melville we don't want to be in the poets' walk in san francisco even we just want to be rich and walk on girders in our silver hats i wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is thinking of me as i shake hands with leroi and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go back to work happy at the thought possibly so, mothers of america let your kids go to the movies! get them out of the house so they wont know what youre up to its true that fresh air is good for the body but what about the soul that grows in darkness, embossed by silvery images and when you grow old as grow old you must they wont hate you they wont criticize you they wont know theyll be in some glamorous country they first saw on a saturday afternoon or playing hookey they may even be grateful to you for their first sexual experience which only cost you a quarter and didnt upset the peaceful home they will know where candy bars come from and gratuitous bags of popcorn as gratuitous as leaving the movie before its over with a pleasant stranger whose apartment is in the heaven on earth bldg near the williamsburg bridge oh mothers you will have made the little tykes so happy because if nobody does pick them up in the movies they wont know the difference and if somebody does itll be sheer gravy and theyll have been truly entertained either way instead of hanging around the yard or up in their room hating you prematurely since you wont have done anything horribly mean yet except keeping them from the darker joys its unforgivable the latter so dont blame me if you wont take this advice and the family breaks up and your children grow old and blind in front of a tv set seeing movies you wouldnt let them see when they were young, it is 12:20 in new york a friday three days after bastille day, yes it is 1959 and i go get a shoeshine because i will get off the 4:19 in easthampton at 7:15 and then go straight to dinner and i dont know the people who will feed me i walk up the muggy street beginning to sun and have a hamburger and a malted and buy an ugly new world writing to see what the poets in ghana are doing these days i go on to the bank and miss stillwagon (first name linda i once heard) doesnt even look up my balance for once in her life and in the golden griffin i get a little verlaine for patsy with drawings by bonnard although i do think of hesiod, trans. richmond lattimore or brendan behans new play or le balcon or les nã¨gres of genet, but i dont, i stick with verlaine after practically going to sleep with quandariness and for mike i just stroll into the park lane liquor store and ask for a bottle of strega and then i go back where i came from to 6th avenue and the tobacconist in the ziegfeld theatre and casually ask for a carton of gauloises and a carton of picayunes, and a new york post with her face on it and i am sweating a lot by now and thinking of leaning on the john door in the 5 spot while she whispered a song along the keyboard to mal waldron and everyone and i stopped breathing]"
