      "[[  it was a bright cold day in april, and the clocks were striking thirteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston made for the stairs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was no use trying the lift., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was part of the economy drive in preparation for hate week., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the flat was seven flights up, and winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother is watching you, the caption beneath it ran., 'Orwell', '1984'], [inside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended., 'Orwell', '1984'], [outside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold., 'Orwell', '1984'], [down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the black-moustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was one on the house-front immediately opposite., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother is watching you, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into winston's own., 'Orwell', '1984'], [down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the patrols did not matter, however., 'Orwell', '1984'], [only the thought police mattered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [behind winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the ninth three-year plan., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [any sound that winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [how often, or on what system, the thought police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you had to live--did live, from habit that became instinct--in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston kept his back turned to the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was safer; though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a kilometre away the ministry of truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this, he thought with a sort of vague distaste--, 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was london, chief city of airstrip one, itself, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the third most populous of the provinces of oceania., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether london had always been quite like this., 'Orwell', '1984'], [were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? and the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it was no use, 'Orwell', '1984'], [, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of truth--minitrue, in newspeak [newspeak was the official language of oceania., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for an account of its structure and etymology see appendix.]--was startlingly different from any other object in sight., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from where winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the party: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength the ministry of truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below., 'Orwell', '1984'], [scattered about london there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of victory mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were the homes of the four ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of peace, which concerned itself with war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of love, which maintained law and order. and the ministry of plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [their names, in newspeak: minitrue, minipax, miniluv, and miniplenty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of love was the really frightening one., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were no windows in it at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston had never been inside the ministry of love, nor within half a kilometre of it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston turned round abruptly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he crossed the room into the tiny kitchen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by leaving the ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked victory gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of chinese rice-spirit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [instantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked victory cigarettes and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the next he was more successful., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position., 'Orwell', '1984'], [instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a peculiarly beautiful book., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could guess, however, that the book was much older than that., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops ('dealing on the free market', it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thing that he was about to do was to open a diary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually he was not used to writing by hand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a tremor had gone through his bowels., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to mark the paper was the decisive act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in small clumsy letters he wrote: april 4th, 1984., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat back., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the future, for the unborn., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the newspeak word doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [how could you communicate with the future?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was of its nature impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the telescreen had changed over to strident military music., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the actual writing would be easy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the seconds were ticking by., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops: april 4th, 1984., 'Orwell', '1984'], [last night to the flicks., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all war films., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the mediterranean., 'Orwell', '1984'], [audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round, 'Orwell', '1984'], [him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it aint right not in front of kids, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it aint until the police turned her, 'Orwell', '1984'], [turned her out, 'Orwell', '1984'], [i dont suppose anything happened to, 'Orwell', '1984'], [her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never---- winston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had happened that morning at the ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was nearly eleven hundred, and in the records department, where winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the two minutes hate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the fiction department., 'Orwell', '1984'], [presumably--since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner--she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the junior anti-sex league, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew the reason., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most., 'Orwell', '1984'], [once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the thought police., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that, it was true, was very unlikely., 'Orwell', '1984'], [still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the other person was a man named o'brien, a member of the inner party and holder of some post so important and remote that winston had only a dim idea of its nature., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an inner party member approaching., 'Orwell', '1984'], [o'brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming--in some indefinable way, curiously civilized., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston had seen o'brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between o'brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique., 'Orwell', '1984'], [much more it was because of a secretly held belief--or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope--that o'brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect., 'Orwell', '1984'], [something in his face suggested it irresistibly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment o'brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the records department until the two minutes hate was over., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took a chair in the same row as winston, a couple of places away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to winston was between them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the hate had started., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as usual, the face of emmanuel goldstein, the enemy of the people, had flashed on to the screen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were hisses here and there among the audience., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust., 'Orwell', '1984'], [goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the party, almost on a level with big brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the programmes of the two minutes hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which goldstein was not the principal figure., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the party's purity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all subsequent crimes against the party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching., 'Orwell', '1984'], [somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even--so it was occasionally rumoured--in some hiding-place in oceania itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston's diaphragm was constricted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could never see the face of goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a lean jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard--a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality., 'Orwell', '1984'], [goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the party--an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was abusing big brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed--and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the party, and even contained newspeak words: more newspeak words, indeed, than any party member would normally use in real life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the eurasian army--row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers' boots formed the background to goldstein's bleating voice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [before the hate had proceeded for thirty seconds, uncontrollable exclamations of rage were breaking out from half the people in the room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the self-satisfied sheep-like face on the screen, and the terrifying power of the eurasian army behind it, were too much to be borne: besides, the sight or even the thought of goldstein produced fear and anger automatically., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was an object of hatred more constant than either eurasia or eastasia, since when oceania was at war with one of these powers it was generally at peace with the other., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but what was strange was that although goldstein was hated and despised by everybody, although every day and a thousand times a day, on platforms, on the telescreen, in newspapers, in books, his theories were refuted, smashed, ridiculed, held up to the general gaze for the pitiful rubbish that they were--in spite of all this, his influence never seemed to grow less., 'Orwell', '1984'], [always there were fresh dupes waiting to be seduced by him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a day never passed when spies and saboteurs acting under his directions were not unmasked by the thought police., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was the commander of a vast shadowy army, an underground network of conspirators dedicated to the overthrow of the state., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the brotherhood, its name was supposed to be., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were also whispered stories of a terrible book, a compendium of all the heresies, of which goldstein was the author and which circulated clandestinely here and there., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a book without a title., 'Orwell', '1984'], [people referred to it, if at all, simply as the book., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but one knew of such things only through vague rumours., 'Orwell', '1984'], [neither the brotherhood nor the book was a subject that any ordinary party member would mention if there was a way of avoiding it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in its second minute the hate rose to a frenzy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [people were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even o'brien's heavy face was flushed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the dark-haired girl behind winston had begun crying out 'swine!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [swine!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [swine!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and suddenly she picked up a heavy newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it struck goldstein's nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in a lucid moment winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the horrible thing about the two minutes hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in., 'Orwell', '1984'], [within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus, at one moment winston's hatred was not turned against goldstein at all, but, on the contrary, against big brother, the party, and the thought police; and at such moments his heart went out to the lonely, derided heretic on the screen, sole guardian of truth and sanity in a world of lies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet the very next instant he was at one with the people about him, and all that was said of goldstein seemed to him to be true., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at those moments his secret loathing of big brother changed into adoration, and big brother seemed to tower up, an invincible, fearless protector, standing like a rock against the hordes of asia, and goldstein, in spite of his isolation, his helplessness, and the doubt that hung about his very existence, seemed like some sinister enchanter, capable by the mere power of his voice of wrecking the structure of civilization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was even possible, at moments, to switch one's hatred this way or that by a voluntary act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly, by the sort of violent effort with which one wrenches one's head away from the pillow in a nightmare, winston succeeded in transferring his hatred from the face on the screen to the dark-haired girl behind him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [vivid, beautiful hallucinations flashed through his mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he would flog her to death with a rubber truncheon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he would tie her naked to a stake and shoot her full of arrows like saint sebastian., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he would ravish her and cut her throat at the moment of climax., 'Orwell', '1984'], [better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the hate rose to its climax., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the voice of goldstein had become an actual sheep's bleat, and for an instant the face changed into that of a sheep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then the sheep-face melted into the figure of a eurasian soldier who seemed to be advancing, huge and terrible, his sub-machine gun roaring, and seeming to spring out of the surface of the screen, so that some of the people in the front row actually flinched backwards in their seats., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in the same moment, drawing a deep sigh of relief from everybody, the hostile figure melted into the face of big brother, black-haired, black-moustachio'd, full of power and mysterious calm, and so vast that it almost filled up the screen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nobody heard what big brother was saying., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was merely a few words of encouragement, the sort of words that are uttered in the din of battle, not distinguishable individually but restoring confidence by the fact of being spoken., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then the face of big brother faded away again, and instead the three slogans of the party stood out in bold capitals: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength but the face of big brother seemed to persist for several seconds on the screen, as though the impact that it had made on everyone's eyeballs was too vivid to wear off immediately., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the little sandy-haired woman had flung herself forward over the back of the chair in front of her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with a tremulous murmur that sounded like 'my saviour!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she extended her arms towards the screen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then she buried her face in her hands., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was apparent that she was uttering a prayer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmical chant of 'b-b!...b-b!'--over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'b' and the second--a heavy, murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamp of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of big brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston's entrails seemed to grow cold., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the two minutes hate he could not help sharing in the general delirium, but this sub-human chanting of 'b-b!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [...b-b!' always filled him with horror., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course he chanted with the rest: it was impossible to do otherwise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to dissemble your feelings, to control your face, to do what everyone else was doing, was an instinctive reaction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened--if, indeed, it did happen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [momentarily he caught o'brien's eye., 'Orwell', '1984'], [o'brien had stood up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there was a fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen winston knew--yes, 'Orwell', '1984'], [, he knew!--that o'brien was thinking the same thing as himself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [an unmistakable message had passed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other through their eyes. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i am with you,' o'brien seemed to be saying to him. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i know precisely what you are feeling., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but don't worry, i am on your side!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and then the flash of intelligence was gone, and o'brien's face was as inscrutable as everybody else's., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [such incidents never had any sequel., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the enemies of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all--perhaps the brotherhood really existed!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and executions, to be sure that the brotherhood was not simply a myth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some days he believed in it, some days not., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls--once, even, when two strangers met, a small movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was all guesswork: very likely he had imagined everything., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had gone back to his cubicle without looking at o'brien again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would have been inconceivably dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a second, two seconds, they had exchanged an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but even that was a memorable event, in the locked loneliness in which one had to live., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston roused himself and sat up straighter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he let out a belch., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the gin was rising from his stomach., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his eyes re-focused on the page., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been writing, as though by automatic action., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as before., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals-- down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother down with big brother over and over again, filling half a page., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could not help feeling a twinge of panic., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was absurd, since the writing of those particular words was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not do so, however, because he knew that it was useless., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whether he wrote down with big brother, or whether he refrained from writing it, made no difference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whether he went on with the diary, or whether he did not go on with it, made no difference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thought police would get him just the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had committed--would still have committed, even if he had never set pen to paper--the essential crime that contained all others in itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thoughtcrime, they called it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thoughtcrime was not a thing that could be concealed for ever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you might dodge successfully for a while, even for years, but sooner or later they were bound to get you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was always at night--the arrests invariably happened at night., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sudden jerk out of sleep, the rough hand shaking your shoulder, the lights glaring in your eyes, the ring of hard faces round the bed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the vast majority of cases there was no trial, no report of the arrest., 'Orwell', '1984'], [people simply disappeared, always during the night., 'Orwell', '1984'], [your name was removed from the registers, every record of everything you had ever done was wiped out, your one-time existence was denied and then forgotten., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you were abolished, annihilated: vaporized was the usual word., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a moment he was seized by a kind of hysteria., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he began writing in a hurried untidy scrawl: theyll shoot me i don't care theyll shoot me in the back of the neck, 'Orwell', '1984'], [i dont care down with big brother they always shoot you in the back of the neck, 'Orwell', '1984'], [i dont care down with big brother----, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat back in his chair, slightly ashamed of himself, and laid down the pen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the next moment he started violently., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a knocking at the door., 'Orwell', '1984'], [already!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat as still as a mouse, in the futile hope that whoever it was might go away after a single attempt., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but no, the knocking was repeated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the worst thing of all would be to delay., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his heart was thumping like a drum, but his face, from long habit, was probably expressionless., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he got up and moved heavily towards the door.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [as he put his hand to the door-knob winston, 'Orwell', '1984'], [saw that he had left the diary open on the table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [down with big brother was written all over it, in letters almost big enough to be legible across the room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was an inconceivably stupid thing to have done., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but, he realized, even in his panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book while the ink was wet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he drew in his breath and opened the door., 'Orwell', '1984'], [instantly a warm wave of relief flowed through him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair and a lined face, was standing outside. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [oh, comrade,', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'i thought i heard you come in., 'Orwell', '1984'], [do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it's got blocked up, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and----, 'Orwell', '1984'], [' it was mrs parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [('mrs' was a word somewhat discountenanced by the party--you were supposed to call everyone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.), 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was a woman of about thirty, but looking much older., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one had the impression that there was dust in the creases of her face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston followed her down the passage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [victory mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were falling to pieces., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the plaster flaked constantly from ceilings and walls, the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not closed down altogether from motives of economy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [repairs, except what you could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course it's only because tom isn't home,' said mrs parsons vaguely., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the parsons' flat was bigger than winston's, and dingy in a different way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the place had just been visited by some large violent animal., 'Orwell', '1984'], [games impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies, and a full-sized poster of big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was the usual boiled-cabbage smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing from the telescreen. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [it's the children,' said mrs parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance at the door. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [they haven't been out today., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and of course----' she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the kitchen sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt worse than ever of cabbage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint of the pipe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was always liable to start him coughing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [mrs parsons looked on helplessly. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course if tom was home he'd put it right in a moment,' she said. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he loves anything like that., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he's ever so good with his hands, tom is.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [parsons was winston's fellow-employee at the ministry of truth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the party depended., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the youth league, and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at the ministry he was employed in some subordinate post for which intelligence was not required, but on the other hand he was a leading figure on the sports committee and all the other committees engaged in organizing community hikes, spontaneous demonstrations, savings campaigns, and voluntary activities generally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the community centre every evening for the past four years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [an overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [have you got a spanner?', 'Orwell', '1984'], [said winston, fiddling with the nut on the angle-joint. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [a spanner,' said mrs parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i don't know, i'm sure., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps the children----' there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the children charged into the living-room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [mrs parsons brought the spanner., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair that had blocked up the pipe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he cleaned his fingers as best he could in the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [up with your hands!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [yelled a savage voice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a handsome, tough-looking boy of nine had popped up from behind the table and was menacing him with a toy automatic pistol, while his small sister, about two years younger, made the same gesture with a fragment of wood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [both of them were dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirts, and red neckerchiefs which were the uniform of the spies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston raised his hands above his head, but with an uneasy feeling, so vicious was the boy's demeanour, that it was not altogether a game.

', 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceania, 'tis for thee' gave way to lighter music., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston walked over to the window, keeping his back to the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the day was still cold and clear., 'Orwell', '1984'], [somewhere far away a rocket bomb exploded with a dull, reverberating roar., 'Orwell', '1984'], [about twenty or thirty of them a week were falling on london at present., 'Orwell', '1984'], [down in the street the wind flapped the torn poster to and fro, and the word ingsoc fitfully appeared and vanished., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sacred principles of ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspeak, doublethink, the mutability of the past., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he felt as though he were wandering in the forests of the sea bottom, lost in a monstrous world where he himself was the monster., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the past was dead, the future was unimaginable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what certainty had he that a single human creature now living was on his side?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and what way of knowing that the dominion of the party would not endure for ever?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [like an answer, the three slogans on the white face of the ministry of truth came back to him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength he took a twenty-five cent piece out of his pocket., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there, too, in tiny clear lettering, the same slogans were inscribed, and on the other face of the coin the head of big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even from the coin the eyes pursued you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on coins, on stamps, on the covers of books, on banners, on posters, and on the wrappings of a cigarette packet--everywhere., 'Orwell', '1984'], [always the eyes watching you and the voice enveloping you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [asleep or awake, working or eating, indoors or out of doors, in the bath or in bed--no escape., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nothing was your own except the few cubic centimetres inside your skull., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sun had shifted round, and the myriad windows of the ministry of truth, with the light no longer shining on them, looked grim as the loopholes of a fortress., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his heart quailed before the enormous pyramidal shape., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was too strong, it could not be stormed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a thousand rocket bombs would not batter it down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wondered again for whom he was writing the diary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the future, for the past--for an age that might be imaginary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in front of him there lay not death but annihilation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the diary would be reduced to ashes and himself to vapour., 'Orwell', '1984'], [only the thought police would read what he had written, before they wiped it out of existence and out of memory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [how could you make appeal to the future when not a trace of you, not even an anonymous word scribbled on a piece of paper, could physically survive?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the telescreen struck fourteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he must leave in ten minutes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had to be back at work by fourteen-thirty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [curiously, the chiming of the hour seemed to have put new heart into him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was a lonely ghost uttering a truth that nobody would ever hear., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but so long as he uttered it, in some obscure way the continuity was not broken., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went back to the table, dipped his pen, and wrote: to the future or to the past, to a time when thought is free, when men are different from one another and do not live alone--to a time when truth exists and what is done cannot be undone: from the age of uniformity, from the age of solitude, from the age of big brother, from the age of doublethink--greetings!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was already dead, he reflected., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the consequences of every act are included in the act itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wrote: thoughtcrime does not entail death: thoughtcrime is death., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [two fingers of his right hand were inkstained., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was exactly the kind of detail that might betray you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some nosing zealot in the ministry (a woman, probably: someone like the little sandy-haired woman or the dark-haired girl from the fiction department) might start wondering why he had been writing during the lunch interval, why he had used an old-fashioned pen, what he had been writing--and then drop a hint in the appropriate quarter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went to the bathroom and carefully scrubbed the ink away with the gritty dark-brown soap which rasped your skin like sandpaper and was therefore well adapted for this purpose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he put the diary away in the drawer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was quite useless to think of hiding it, but he could at least make sure whether or not its existence had been discovered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a hair laid across the page-ends was too obvious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the tip of his finger he picked up an identifiable grain of whitish dust and deposited it on the corner of the cover, where it was bound to be shaken off if the book was moved.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was dreaming of his mother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he must, he thought, have been ten or eleven years old when his mother had disappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was a tall, statuesque, rather silent woman with slow movements and magnificent fair hair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his father he remembered more vaguely as dark and thin, dressed always in neat dark clothes (winston remembered especially the very thin soles of his father's shoes) and wearing spectacles., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the two of them must evidently have been swallowed up in one of the first great purges of the fifties., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment his mother was sitting in some place deep down beneath him, with his young sister in her arms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not remember his sister at all, except as a tiny, feeble baby, always silent, with large, watchful eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [both of them were looking up at him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were down in some subterranean place--the bottom of a well, for instance, or a very deep grave--but it was a place which, already far below him, was itself moving downwards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were in the saloon of a sinking ship, looking up at him through the darkening water., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was still air in the saloon, they could still see him and he them, but all the while they were sinking down, down into the green waters which in another moment must hide them from sight for ever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was out in the light and air while they were being sucked down to death, and they were down there because he was up here., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew it and they knew it, and he could see the knowledge in their faces., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no reproach either in their faces or in their hearts, only the knowledge that they must die in order that he might remain alive, and that this was part of the unavoidable order of things., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could not remember what had happened, but he knew in his dream that in some way the lives of his mother and his sister had been sacrificed to his own., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was one of those dreams which, while retaining the characteristic dream scenery, are a continuation of one's intellectual life, and in which one becomes aware of facts and ideas which still seem new and valuable after one is awake., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thing that now suddenly struck winston was that his mother's death, nearly thirty years ago, had been tragic and sorrowful in a way that was no longer possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [tragedy, he perceived, belonged to the ancient time, to a time when there was still privacy, love, and friendship, and when the members of a family stood by one another without needing to know the reason., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his mother's memory tore at his heart because she had died loving him, when he was too young and selfish to love her in return, and because somehow, he did not remember how, she had sacrificed herself to a conception of loyalty that was private and unalterable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [such things, he saw, could not happen today., 'Orwell', '1984'], [today there were fear, hatred, and pain, but no dignity of emotion, no deep or complex sorrows., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all this he seemed to see in the large eyes of his mother and his sister, looking up at him through the green water, hundreds of fathoms down and still sinking., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly he was standing on short springy turf, on a summer evening when the slanting rays of the sun gilded the ground., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the landscape that he was looking at recurred so often in his dreams that he was never fully certain whether or not he had seen it in the real world., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in his waking thoughts he called it the golden country., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was an old, rabbit-bitten pasture, with a foot-track wandering across it and a molehill here and there., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the ragged hedge on the opposite side of the field the boughs of the elm trees were swaying very faintly in the breeze, their leaves just stirring in dense masses like women's hair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [somewhere near at hand, though out of sight, there was a clear, slow-moving stream where dace were swimming in the pools under the willow trees., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl with dark hair was coming towards them across the field., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with what seemed a single movement she tore off her clothes and flung them disdainfully aside., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her body was white and smooth, but it aroused no desire in him, indeed he barely looked at it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what overwhelmed him in that instant was admiration for the gesture with which she had thrown her clothes aside., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with its grace and carelessness it seemed to annihilate a whole culture, a whole system of thought, as though big brother and the party and the thought police could all be swept into nothingness by a single splendid movement of the arm., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that too was a gesture belonging to the ancient time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston woke up with the word 'shakespeare' on his lips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston wrenched his body out of bed--naked, for a member of the outer party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600--and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the physical jerks would begin in three minutes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the next moment he was doubled up by a violent coughing fit which nearly always attacked him soon after waking up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it emptied his lungs so completely that he could only begin breathing again by lying on his back and taking a series of deep gasps., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his veins had swelled with the effort of the cough, and the varicose ulcer had started itching. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [thirty to forty group!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [yapped a piercing female voice. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [thirty to forty group!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [take your places, please., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thirties to forties!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston sprang to attention in front of the telescreen, upon which the image of a youngish woman, scrawny but muscular, dressed in tunic and gym-shoes, had already appeared. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [arms bending and stretching!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she rapped out. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [take your time by me., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one, two, three, four!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [one, two, three, four!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [come on, comrades, put a bit of life into it!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [one, two, three four!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [one two, three, four!...', 'Orwell', '1984'], [the pain of the coughing fit had not quite driven out of winston's mind the impression made by his dream, and the rhythmic movements of the exercise restored it somewhat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as he mechanically shot his arms back and forth, wearing on his face the look of grim enjoyment which was considered proper during the physical jerks, he was struggling to think his way backward into the dim period of his early childhood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was extraordinarily difficult., 'Orwell', '1984'], [beyond the late fifties everything faded., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when there were no external records that you could refer to, even the outline of your own life lost its sharpness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you remembered huge events which had quite probably not happened, you remembered the detail of incidents without being able to recapture their atmosphere, and there were long blank periods to which you could assign nothing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everything had been different then., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different., 'Orwell', '1984'], [airstrip one, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called england or britain, though london, he felt fairly certain, had always been called london., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston could not definitely remember a time when his country had not been at war, but it was evident that there had been a fairly long interval of peace during his childhood, because one of his early memories was of an air raid which appeared to take everyone by surprise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps it was the time when the atomic bomb had fallen on colchester., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not remember the raid itself, but he did remember his father's hand clutching his own as they hurried down, down, down into some place deep in the earth, round and round a spiral staircase which rang under his feet and which finally so wearied his legs that he began whimpering and they had to stop and rest., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his mother, in her slow, dreamy way, was following a long way behind them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was carrying his baby sister--or perhaps it was only a bundle of blankets that she was carrying: he was not certain whether his sister had been born then., 'Orwell', '1984'], [finally they had emerged into a noisy, crowded place which he had realized to be a tube station., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were people sitting all over the stone-flagged floor, and other people, packed tightly together, were sitting on metal bunks, one above the other., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston and his mother and father found themselves a place on the floor, and near them an old man and an old woman were sitting side by side on a bunk., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the old man had on a decent dark suit and a black cloth cap pushed back from very white hair: his face was scarlet and his eyes were blue and full of tears., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he reeked of gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it seemed to breathe out of his skin in place of sweat, and one could have fancied that the tears welling from his eyes were pure gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but though slightly drunk he was also suffering under some grief that was genuine and unbearable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in his childish way winston grasped that some terrible thing, something that was beyond forgiveness and could never be remedied, had just happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it also seemed to him that he knew what it was., 'Orwell', '1984'], [someone whom the old man loved--a little granddaughter, perhaps--had been killed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [every few minutes the old man kept repeating: 'we didn't ought to 'ave trusted 'em., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i said so, ma, didn't i?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [that's what comes of trusting 'em., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i said so all along., 'Orwell', '1984'], [we didn't ought to 'ave trusted the buggers.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [but which buggers they didn't ought to have trusted winston could not now remember., 'Orwell', '1984'], [since about that time, war had been literally continuous, though strictly speaking it had not always been the same war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for several months during his childhood there had been confused street fighting in london itself, some of which he remembered vividly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but to trace out the history of the whole period, to say who was fighting whom at any given moment, would have been utterly impossible, since no written record, and no spoken word, ever made mention of any other alignment than the existing one., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment, for example, in 1984 (if it was 1984), oceania was at war with eurasia and in alliance with eastasia., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in no public or private utterance was it ever admitted that the three powers had at any time been grouped along different lines., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually, as winston well knew, it was only four years since oceania had been at war with eastasia and in alliance with eurasia., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but that was merely a piece of furtive knowledge which he happened to possess because his memory was not satisfactorily under control., 'Orwell', '1984'], [officially the change of partners had never happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceania was at war with eurasia: therefore oceania had always been at war with eurasia., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the enemy of the moment always represented absolute evil, and it followed that any past or future agreement with him was impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the frightening thing, he reflected for the ten thousandth time as he forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be good for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all be true., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened--that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he, winston smith, knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short a time as four years ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but where did that knowledge exist?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [only in his own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and if all others accepted the lie which the party imposed--if all records told the same tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [who controls the past,' ran the party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was quite simple., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [reality control', they called it: in newspeak, 'doublethink'. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [stand easy!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [barked the instructress, a little more genially., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston sank his arms to his sides and slowly refilled his lungs with air., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his mind slid away into the labyrinthine world of doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the party was the guardian of democracy, to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even to understand the word 'doublethink' involved the use of doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the instructress had called them to attention again. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and now let's see which of us can touch our toes!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she said enthusiastically. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [right over from the hips, please, comrades., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one-two!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [one-two!...', 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston loathed this exercise, which sent shooting pains all the way from his heels to his buttocks and often ended by bringing on another coughing fit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the half-pleasant quality went out of his meditations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the past, he reflected, had not merely been altered, it had been actually destroyed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for how could you establish even the most obvious fact when there existed no record outside your own memory?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he tried to remember in what year he had first heard mention of big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the party histories, of course, big brother figured as the leader and guardian of the revolution since its very earliest days., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of london in great gleaming motor-cars or horse carriages with glass sides., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no knowing how much of this legend was true and how much invented., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston could not even remember at what date the party itself had come into existence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not believe he had ever heard the word ingsoc before 1960, but it was possible that in its oldspeak form--'english socialism', that is to say--it had been current earlier., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everything melted into mist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sometimes, indeed, you could put your finger on a definite lie., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not true, for example, as was claimed in the party history books, that the party had invented aeroplanes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered aeroplanes since his earliest childhood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but you could prove nothing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was never any evidence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [just once in his whole life he had held in his hands unmistakable documentary proof of the falsification of an historical fact., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and on that occasion---- 'smith!' screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [6079 smith w.!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [yes, you! bend lower, please!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [you can do better than that., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you're not trying., 'Orwell', '1984'], [lower, please! that's better, comrade., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now stand at ease, the whole squad, and watch me.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [a sudden hot sweat had broken out all over winston's body., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his face remained completely inscrutable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [never show dismay!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [never show resentment!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [a single flicker of the eyes could give you away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he stood watching while the instructress raised her arms above her head, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and--one could not say gracefully, but with remarkable neatness and efficiency--bent over and tucked the first joint of her fingers under her toes. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [there, comrades!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [that's how i want to see you doing it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [watch me again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i'm thirty-nine, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and i've had four children., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now look.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she bent over again. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [you see my knees aren't bent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you can all do it if you want to,' she added as she straightened herself up. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [anyone under forty-five is perfectly capable of touching his toes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [we don't all have the privilege of fighting in the front line, but at least we can all keep fit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [remember our boys on the malabar front!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and the sailors in the floating fortresses! just think what they have to put up with., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now try again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that's better, comrade, that's much better,' she added encouragingly as winston, with a violent lunge, succeeded in touching his toes with knees unbent, for the first time in several years.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the deep, unconscious sigh which not even the nearness of the telescreen could prevent him from uttering when his day's work started, winston pulled the speakwrite towards him, blew the dust from its mouthpiece, and put on his spectacles., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then he unrolled and clipped together four small cylinders of paper which had already flopped out of the pneumatic tube on the right-hand side of his desk., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the walls of the cubicle there were three orifices., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to the right of the speakwrite, a small pneumatic tube for written messages, to the left, a larger one for newspapers; and in the side wall, within easy reach of winston's arm, a large oblong slit protected by a wire grating., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this last was for the disposal of waste paper., 'Orwell', '1984'], [similar slits existed in thousands or tens of thousands throughout the building, not only in every room but at short intervals in every corridor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for some reason they were nicknamed memory holes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when one knew that any document was due for destruction, or even when one saw a scrap of waste paper lying about, it was an automatic action to lift the flap of the nearest memory hole and drop it in, whereupon it would be whirled away on a current of warm air to the enormous furnaces which were hidden somewhere in the recesses of the building., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston examined the four slips of paper which he had unrolled., 'Orwell', '1984'], [each contained a message of only one or two lines, in the abbreviated jargon--not actually newspeak, but consisting largely of newspeak words--which was used in the ministry for internal purposes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they ran: times 17.3.84, 'Orwell', '1984'], [bb speech malreported africa rectify times 19.12.83 forecasts 3 yp 4th quarter 83 misprints verify current issue times 14.2.84 miniplenty malquoted chocolate rectify times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling with a faint feeling of satisfaction winston laid the fourth message aside., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was an intricate and responsible job and had better be dealt with last., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the other three were routine matters, though the second one would probably mean some tedious wading through lists of figures., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston dialled 'back numbers' on the telescreen and called for the appropriate issues of 'the times', which slid out of the pneumatic tube after only a few minutes' delay., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the messages he had received referred to articles or news items which for one reason or another it was thought necessary to alter, or, as the official phrase had it, to rectify., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for example, it appeared from 'the times' of the seventeenth of march that big brother, in his speech of the previous day, had predicted that the south indian front would remain quiet but that a eurasian offensive would shortly be launched in north africa., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as it happened, the eurasian higher command had launched its offensive in south india and left north africa alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was therefore necessary to rewrite a paragraph of big brother's speech, in such a way as to make him predict the thing that had actually happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [or again, 'the times' of the nineteenth of december had published the official forecasts of the output of various classes of consumption goods in the fourth quarter of 1983, which was also the sixth quarter of the ninth three-year plan., 'Orwell', '1984'], [today's issue contained a statement of the actual output, from which it appeared that the forecasts were in every instance grossly wrong., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston's job was to rectify the original figures by making them agree with the later ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as for the third message, it referred to a very simple error which could be set right in a couple of minutes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as short a time ago as february, the ministry of plenty had issued a promise (a 'categorical pledge' were the official words) that there would be no reduction of the chocolate ration during 1984., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually, as winston was aware, the chocolate ration was to be reduced from thirty grammes to twenty at the end of the present week., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that was needed was to substitute for the original promise a warning that it would probably be necessary to reduce the ration at some time in april., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as soon as winston had dealt with each of the messages, he clipped his speakwritten corrections to the appropriate copy of 'the times' and pushed them into the pneumatic tube., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then, with a movement which was as nearly as possible unconscious, he crumpled up the original message and any notes that he himself had made, and dropped them into the memory hole to be devoured by the flames., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what happened in the unseen labyrinth to which the pneumatic tubes led, he did not know in detail, but he did know in general terms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as soon as all the corrections which happened to be necessary in any particular number of 'the times' had been assembled and collated, that number would be reprinted, the original copy destroyed, and the corrected copy placed on the files in its stead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this process of continuous alteration was applied not only to newspapers, but to books, periodicals, pamphlets, posters, leaflets, films, sound-tracks, cartoons, photographs--to every kind of literature or documentation which might conceivably hold any political or ideological significance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in this way every prediction made by the party could be shown by documentary evidence to have been correct, nor was any item of news, or any expression of opinion, which conflicted with the needs of the moment, ever allowed to remain on record., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all history was a palimpsest, scraped clean and reinscribed exactly as often as was necessary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in no case would it have been possible, once the deed was done, to prove that any falsification had taken place., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the largest section of the records department, far larger than the one on which winston worked, consisted simply of persons whose duty it was to track down and collect all copies of books, newspapers, and other documents which had been superseded and were due for destruction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a number of 'the times' which might, because of changes in political alignment, or mistaken prophecies uttered by big brother, have been rewritten a dozen times still stood on the files bearing its original date, and no other copy existed to contradict it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the written instructions which winston received, and which he invariably got rid of as soon as he had dealt with them, never stated or implied that an act of forgery was to be committed: always the reference was to slips, errors, misprints, or misquotations which it was necessary to put right in the interests of accuracy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but actually, he thought as he re-adjusted the ministry of plenty's figures, it was not even forgery., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [most of the material that you were dealing with had no connexion with anything in the real world, not even the kind of connexion that is contained in a direct lie., 'Orwell', '1984'], [statistics were just as much a fantasy in their original version as in their rectified version., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a great deal of the time you were expected to make them up out of your head., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for example, the ministry of plenty's forecast had estimated the output of boots for the quarter at 145 million pairs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the actual output was given as sixty-two millions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston, however, in rewriting the forecast, marked the figure down to fifty-seven millions, so as to allow for the usual claim that the quota had been overfulfilled., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in any case, sixty-two millions was no nearer the truth than fifty-seven millions, or than 145 millions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very likely no boots had been produced at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [likelier still, nobody knew how many had been produced, much less cared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all one knew was that every quarter astronomical numbers of boots were produced on paper, while perhaps half the population of oceania went barefoot., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and so it was with every class of recorded fact, great or small., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everything faded away into a shadow-world in which, finally, even the date of the year had become uncertain., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston glanced across the hall., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the corresponding cubicle on the other side a small, precise-looking, dark-chinned man named tillotson was working steadily away, with a folded newspaper on his knee and his mouth very close to the mouthpiece of the speakwrite., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had the air of trying to keep what he was saying a secret between himself and the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he looked up, and his spectacles darted a hostile flash in winston's direction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston hardly knew tillotson, and had no idea what work he was employed on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [people in the records department did not readily talk about their jobs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the long, windowless hall, with its double row of cubicles and its endless rustle of papers and hum of voices murmuring into speakwrites, there were quite a dozen people whom winston did not even know by name, though he daily saw them hurrying to and fro in the corridors or gesticulating in the two minutes hate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew that in the cubicle next to him the little woman with sandy hair toiled day in day out, simply at tracking down and deleting from the press the names of people who had been vaporized and were therefore considered never to have existed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a certain fitness in this, since her own husband had been vaporized a couple of years earlier., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and a few cubicles away a mild, ineffectual, dreamy creature named ampleforth, with very hairy ears and a surprising talent for juggling with rhymes and metres, was engaged in producing garbled versions--definitive texts, they were called--of poems which had become ideologically offensive, but which for one reason or another were to be retained in the anthologies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and this hall, with its fifty workers or thereabouts, was only one sub-section, a single cell, as it were, in the huge complexity of the records department., 'Orwell', '1984'], [beyond, above, below, were other swarms of workers engaged in an unimaginable multitude of jobs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were the huge printing-shops with their sub-editors, their typography experts, and their elaborately equipped studios for the faking of photographs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was the tele-programmes section with its engineers, its producers, and its teams of actors specially chosen for their skill in imitating voices., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were the armies of reference clerks whose job was simply to draw up lists of books and periodicals which were due for recall., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were the vast repositories where the corrected documents were stored, and the hidden furnaces where the original copies were destroyed. and somewhere or other, quite anonymous, there were the directing brains who co-ordinated the whole effort and laid down the lines of policy which made it necessary that this fragment of the past should be preserved, that one falsified, and the other rubbed out of existence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and the records department, after all, was itself only a single branch of the ministry of truth, whose primary job was not to reconstruct the past but to supply the citizens of oceania with newspapers, films, textbooks, telescreen programmes, plays, novels--with every conceivable kind of information, instruction, or entertainment, from a statue to a slogan, from a lyric poem to a biological treatise, and from a child's spelling-book to a newspeak dictionary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and the ministry had not only to supply the multifarious needs of the party, but also to repeat the whole operation at a lower level for the benefit of the proletariat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a whole chain of separate departments dealing with proletarian literature, music, drama, and entertainment generally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [here were produced rubbishy newspapers containing almost nothing except sport, crime and astrology, sensational five-cent novelettes, films oozing with sex, and sentimental songs which were composed entirely by mechanical means on a special kind of kaleidoscope known as a versificator., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was even a whole sub-section--pornosec, it was called in newspeak--engaged in producing the lowest kind of pornography, which was sent out in sealed packets and which no party member, other than those who worked on it, was permitted to look at., 'Orwell', '1984'], [three messages had slid out of the pneumatic tube while winston was working, but they were simple matters, and he had disposed of them before the two minutes hate interrupted him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when the hate was over he returned to his cubicle, took the newspeak dictionary from the shelf, pushed the speakwrite to one side, cleaned his spectacles, and settled down to his main job of the morning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston's greatest pleasure in life was in his work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [most of it was a tedious routine, but included in it there were also jobs so difficult and intricate that you could lose yourself in them as in the depths of a mathematical problem--delicate pieces of forgery in which you had nothing to guide you except your knowledge of the principles of ingsoc and your estimate of what the party wanted you to say., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was good at this kind of thing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on occasion he had even been entrusted with the rectification of 'the times' leading articles, which were written entirely in newspeak., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he unrolled the message that he had set aside earlier., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it ran: times 3.12.83 reporting bb dayorder doubleplusungood refs unpersons rewrite fullwise upsub antefiling in oldspeak (or standard english), 'Orwell', '1984'], [this might be rendered: the reporting of big brother's order for the day in 'the times' of december 3rd 1983 is extremely unsatisfactory and makes references to non-existent persons., 'Orwell', '1984'], [rewrite it in full and submit your draft to higher authority before filing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston read through the offending article., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother's order for the day, it seemed, had been chiefly devoted to praising the work of an organization known as ffcc, which supplied cigarettes and other comforts to the sailors in the floating fortresses., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a certain comrade withers, a prominent member of the inner party, had been singled out for special mention and awarded a decoration, the order of conspicuous merit, second class., 'Orwell', '1984'], [three months later ffcc had suddenly been dissolved with no reasons given., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one could assume that withers and his associates were now in disgrace, but there had been no report of the matter in the press or on the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that was to be expected, since it was unusual for political offenders to be put on trial or even publicly denounced., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the great purges involving thousands of people, with public trials of traitors and thought-criminals who made abject confession of their crimes and were afterwards executed, were special show-pieces not occurring oftener than once in a couple of years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [more commonly, people who had incurred the displeasure of the party simply disappeared and were never heard of again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one never had the smallest clue as to what had happened to them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in some cases they might not even be dead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps thirty people personally known to winston, not counting his parents, had disappeared at one time or another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston stroked his nose gently with a paper-clip., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the cubicle across the way comrade tillotson was still crouching secretively over his speakwrite., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he raised his head for a moment: again the hostile spectacle-flash., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston wondered whether comrade tillotson was engaged on the same job as himself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was perfectly possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so tricky, 'Orwell', '1984'], [a piece of work would never be entrusted to a single person: on the other hand, to turn it over to a committee would be to admit openly that an act of fabrication was taking place., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very likely as many as a dozen people were now working away on rival versions of what big brother had actually said., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and presently some master brain in the inner party would select this version or that, would re-edit it and set in motion the complex processes of cross-referencing that would be required, and then the chosen lie would pass into the permanent records and become truth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston did not know why withers had been disgraced., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps it was for corruption or incompetence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps big brother was merely getting rid of a too-popular subordinate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps withers or someone close to him had been suspected of heretical tendencies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [or perhaps--what was likeliest of all--the thing had simply happened because purges and vaporizations were a necessary part of the mechanics of government., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the only real clue lay in the words 'refs unpersons', which indicated that withers was already dead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you could not invariably assume this to be the case when people were arrested., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sometimes they were released and allowed to remain at liberty for as much as a year or two years before being executed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very occasionally some person whom you had believed dead long since would make a ghostly reappearance at some public trial where he would implicate hundreds of others by his testimony before vanishing, this time for ever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [withers, however, was already an unperson., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not exist: he had never existed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston decided that it would not be enough simply to reverse the tendency of big brother's speech., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was better to make it deal with something totally unconnected with its original subject., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he might turn the speech into the usual denunciation of traitors and thought-criminals, but that was a little too obvious, while to invent a victory at the front, or some triumph of over-production in the ninth three-year plan, might complicate the records too much., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what was needed was a piece of pure fantasy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly there sprang into his mind, ready made as it were, the image of a certain comrade ogilvy, who had recently died in battle, in heroic circumstances., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were occasions when big brother devoted his order for the day to commemorating some humble, rank-and-file party member whose life and death he held up as an example worthy to be followed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [today he should commemorate comrade ogilvy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was true that there was no such person as comrade ogilvy, but a few lines of print and a couple of faked photographs would soon bring him into existence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston thought for a moment, then pulled the speakwrite towards him and began dictating in big brother's familiar style: a style at once military and pedantic, and, because of a trick of asking questions and then promptly answering them ('what lessons do we learn from this fact, comrades?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the lesson--which is also one of the fundamental principles of ingsoc--that,' etc., etc.), easy to imitate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at the age of three comrade ogilvy had refused all toys except a drum, a sub-machine gun, and a model helicopter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at six--a year early, by a special relaxation of the rules--he had joined the spies, at nine he had been a troop leader., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at eleven he had denounced his uncle to the thought police after overhearing a conversation which appeared to him to have criminal tendencies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at seventeen he had been a district organizer of the junior anti-sex league., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at nineteen he had designed a hand-grenade which had been adopted by the ministry of peace and which, at its first trial, had killed thirty-one eurasian prisoners in one burst., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at twenty-three he had perished in action., 'Orwell', '1984'], [pursued by enemy jet planes while flying over the indian ocean with important despatches, he had weighted his body with his machine gun and leapt out of the helicopter into deep water, despatches and all--an end, said big brother, which it was impossible to contemplate without feelings of envy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother added a few remarks on the purity and single-mindedness of comrade ogilvy's life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was a total abstainer and a nonsmoker, had no recreations except a daily hour in the gymnasium, and had taken a vow of celibacy, believing marriage and the care of a family to be incompatible with a twenty-four-hour-a-day devotion to duty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had no subjects of conversation except the principles of ingsoc, and no aim in life except the defeat of the eurasian enemy and the hunting-down of spies, saboteurs, thought-criminals, and traitors generally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston debated with himself whether to award comrade ogilvy the order of conspicuous merit: in the end he decided against it because of the unnecessary cross-referencing that it would entail., 'Orwell', '1984'], [once again he glanced at his rival in the opposite cubicle., 'Orwell', '1984'], [something seemed to tell him with certainty that tillotson was busy on the same job as himself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no way of knowing whose job would finally be adopted, but he felt a profound conviction that it would be his own., 'Orwell', '1984'], [comrade ogilvy, unimagined an hour ago, was now a fact., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it struck him as curious that you could create dead men but not living ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [comrade ogilvy, who had never existed in the present, now existed in the past, and when once the act of forgery was forgotten, he would exist just as authentically, and upon the same evidence, as charlemagne or julius caesar.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the low-ceilinged canteen, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked slowly forward., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour metallic smell which did

'Orwell', '1984'], [little beggars, eh? but keen as mustard!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [that's a first-rate training they give them in the spies nowadays--better than in my day, even., 'Orwell', '1984'],

night--tried it out on our sitting-room door, and reckoned she could hear twice as much as with her ear to the hole., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course it's only a toy, mind you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [still, gives 'em the right idea, eh?' at this moment the telescreen let out a piercing whistle., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the signal to return to work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all three men sprang to their feet to join in the struggle round the lifts, and the remaining tobacco fell out of winston's cigarette.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was writing in his diary: it was three years ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was on a dark evening, in a narrow side-street near one of the big railway stations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was standing near a doorway in the wall, under a street lamp that hardly gave any light., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had a young face, painted very thick., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was really the paint that appealed to me, the whiteness of it, like a mask, and the bright red lips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [party women never paint their faces., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was nobody else in the street, and no telescreens., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she said two dollars., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i---- for the moment it was too difficult to go on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he shut his eyes and pressed his fingers against them, trying to squeeze out the vision that kept recurring., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had an almost overwhelming temptation to shout a string of filthy words at the top of his voice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [or to bang his head against the wall, to kick over the table, and hurl the inkpot through the window--to do any violent or noisy or painful thing that might black out the memory that was tormenting him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [your worst enemy, he reflected, was your own nervous system., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at any moment the tension inside you was liable to translate itself into some visible symptom., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought of a man whom he had passed in the street a few weeks back; a quite ordinary-looking man, a party member, aged thirty-five to forty, tallish and thin, carrying a brief-case., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were a few metres apart when the left side of the man's face was suddenly contorted by a sort of spasm., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it happened again just as they were passing one another: it was only a twitch, a quiver, rapid as the clicking of a camera shutter, but obviously habitual., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered thinking at the time: that poor devil is done for., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and what was frightening was that the action was quite possibly unconscious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the most deadly danger of all was talking in your sleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no way of guarding against that, so far as he could see., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he drew his breath and went on writing: i went with her through the doorway and across a backyard into a basement kitchen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a bed against the wall, and a lamp on the table, turned down very low., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she---- his teeth were set on edge., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he would have liked to spit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [simultaneously with the woman in the basement kitchen he thought of katharine, his wife., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was married--had been married, at any rate: probably he still was married, so far as he knew his wife was not dead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he seemed to breathe again the warm stuffy odour of the basement kitchen, an odour compounded of bugs and dirty clothes and villainous cheap scent, but nevertheless alluring, because no woman of the party ever used scent, or could be imagined as doing so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [only the proles used scent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in his mind the smell of it was inextricably mixed up with fornication., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when he had gone with that woman it had been his first lapse in two years or thereabouts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [consorting with prostitutes was forbidden, of course, but it was one of those rules that you could occasionally nerve yourself to break., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was dangerous, but it was not a life-and-death matter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to be caught with a prostitute might mean five years in a forced-labour camp: not more, if you had committed no other offence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and it was easy enough, provided that you could avoid being caught in the act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the poorer quarters swarmed with women who were ready to sell themselves., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some could even be purchased for a bottle of gin, which the proles were not supposed to drink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [tacitly the party was even inclined to encourage prostitution, as an outlet for instincts which could not be altogether suppressed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [mere debauchery did not matter very much, so long as it was furtive and joyless and only involved the women of a submerged and despised class., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the unforgivable crime was promiscuity between party members., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but--though this was one of the crimes that the accused in the great purges invariably confessed to--it was difficult to imagine any such thing actually happening., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the aim of the party was not merely to prevent men and women from forming loyalties which it might not be able to control., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its real, undeclared purpose was to remove all pleasure from the sexual act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [not love so much as eroticism was the enemy, inside marriage as well as outside it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all marriages between party members had to be approved by a committee appointed for the purpose, and--though the principle was never clearly stated--permission was always refused if the couple concerned gave the impression of being physically attracted to one another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget children for the service of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this again was never put into plain words, but in an indirect way it was rubbed into every party member from childhood onwards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were even organizations such as the junior anti-sex league, which advocated complete celibacy for both sexes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all children were to be begotten by artificial insemination (artsem, it was called in newspeak) and brought up in public institutions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this, winston was aware, was not meant altogether seriously, but somehow it fitted in with the general ideology of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party was trying to kill the sex instinct, or, if it could not be killed, then to distort it and dirty it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not know why this was so, but it seemed natural that it should be so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and as far as the women were concerned, the party's efforts were largely successful., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought again of katharine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it must be nine, ten--nearly eleven years since they had parted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was curious how seldom he thought of her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for days at a time he was capable of forgetting that he had ever been married., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they had only been together for about fifteen months., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party did not permit divorce, but it rather encouraged separation in cases where there were no children., 'Orwell', '1984'], [katharine was a tall, fair-haired girl, very straight, with splendid movements., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had a bold, aquiline face, a face that one might have called noble until one discovered that there was as nearly as possible nothing behind it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very early in her married life he had decided--though perhaps it was only that he knew her more intimately than he knew most people--that she had without exception the most stupid, vulgar, empty mind that he had ever encountered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had not a thought in her head that was not a slogan, and there was no imbecility, absolutely none that she was not capable of swallowing if the party handed it out to her. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [the human sound-track', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he nicknamed her in his own mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [yet he could have endured living with her if it had not been for just one thing--sex., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as soon as he touched her she seemed to wince and stiffen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to embrace her was like embracing a jointed wooden image., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and what was strange was that even when she was clasping him against her he had the feeling that she was simultaneously pushing him away with all her strength., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the rigidity of her muscles managed to convey that impression., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she would lie there with shut eyes, neither resisting nor co-operating but submitting., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was extraordinarily embarrassing, and, after a while, horrible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but even then he could have borne living with her if it had been agreed that they should remain celibate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but curiously enough, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was katharine who refused this., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they must, she said, produce a child if they could., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so the performance continued to happen, once a week quite regularly, whenever it was not impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she even used to remind him of it in the morning, as something which had to be done that evening and which must not be forgotten., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had two names for it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one was 'making a baby', and the other was 'our duty to the party', 'Orwell', '1984'], [(yes, she had actually used that phrase)., 'Orwell', '1984'], [quite soon he grew to have a feeling of positive dread when the appointed day came round., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but luckily no child appeared, and in the end she agreed to give up trying, and soon afterwards they parted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston sighed inaudibly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he picked up his pen again and wrote: she threw herself down on the bed, and at once, without any kind of preliminary in the most coarse, horrible way you can imagine, pulled up her skirt., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i----, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he saw himself standing there in the dim lamplight, with the smell of bugs and cheap scent in his nostrils, and in his heart a feeling of defeat and resentment which even at that moment was mixed up with the thought of katharine's white body, frozen for ever by the hypnotic power of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [why did it always have to be like this?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [why could he not have a woman of his own instead of these filthy scuffles at intervals of years?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [but a real love affair was an almost unthinkable event., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the women of the party were all alike., 'Orwell', '1984'], [chastity was as deep ingrained in them as party loyalty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by careful early conditioning, by games and cold water, by the rubbish that was dinned into them at school and in the spies and the youth league, by lectures, parades, songs, slogans, and martial music, the natural feeling had been driven out of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his reason told him that there must be exceptions, but his heart did not believe it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were all impregnable, as the party intended that they should be., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and what he wanted, more even than to be loved, was to break down that wall of virtue, even if it were only once in his whole life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sexual act, successfully performed, was rebellion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [desire was thoughtcrime., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even to have awakened katharine, if he could have achieved it, would have been like a seduction, although she was his wife., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the rest of the story had got to be written down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wrote: i turned up the lamp., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when i saw her in the light---- after the darkness the feeble light of the paraffin lamp had seemed very bright., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the first time he could see the woman properly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had taken a step towards her and then halted, full of lust and terror., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was painfully conscious of the risk he had taken in coming here., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was perfectly possible that the patrols would catch him on the way out: for that matter they might be waiting outside the door at this moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if he went away without even doing what he had come here to do----!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had got to be written down, it had got to be confessed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what he had suddenly seen in the lamplight was that the woman was old., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the paint was plastered so thick on her face that it looked as though it might crack like a cardboard mask., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were streaks of white in her hair; but the truly dreadful detail was that her mouth had fallen a little open, revealing nothing except a cavernous blackness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had no teeth at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wrote hurriedly, in scrabbling handwriting: when i saw her in the light she was quite an old woman, fifty years old at least., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but i went ahead and did it just the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he pressed his fingers against his eyelids again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had written it down at last, but it made no difference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the therapy had not worked., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the urge to shout filthy words at the top of his voice was as strong as ever.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], ['if there is hope,' wrote winston, 'it lies in the proles., 'Orwell', '1984'], [' if there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of oceania, could the force to destroy the party ever be generated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party could not be overthrown from within., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even of identifying one another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even if the legendary brotherhood existed, as just possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble in larger numbers than twos and threes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [rebellion meant a look in the eyes, an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own strength., 'Orwell', '1984'], [would have no need to conspire., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if they chose they could blow the party to pieces tomorrow morning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet----!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered how once he had been walking down a crowded street when a tremendous shout of hundreds of voices women's voices--had burst from a side-street a little way ahead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a great formidable cry of anger and despair, a deep, loud 'oh-o-o-o-oh!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [that went humming on like the reverberation of a bell., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his heart had leapt., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it's started!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had thought., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a riot!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the proles are breaking loose at last! when he had reached the spot it was to see a mob of two or three hundred women crowding round the stalls of a street market, with faces as tragic as though they had been the doomed passengers on a sinking ship., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but at this moment the general despair broke down into a multitude of individual quarrels., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it appeared that one of the stalls had been selling tin saucepans., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were wretched, flimsy things, but cooking-pots of any kind were always difficult to get., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now the supply had unexpectedly given out., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the successful women, bumped and jostled by the rest, were trying to make off with their saucepans while dozens of others clamoured round the stall, accusing the stall-keeper of favouritism and of having more saucepans somewhere in reserve., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a fresh outburst of yells., 'Orwell', '1984'], [two bloated women, one of them with her hair coming down, had got hold of the same saucepan and were trying to tear it out of one another's hands., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a moment they were both tugging, and then the handle came off., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston watched them disgustedly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet, just for a moment, what almost frightening power had sounded in that cry from only a few hundred throats!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [why was it that they could never shout like that about anything that mattered?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wrote: until they become conscious they will never rebel, and until after they have rebelled they cannot become conscious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that, he reflected, might almost have been a transcription from one of the party textbooks., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party claimed, of course, to have liberated the proles from bondage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [before the revolution they had been hideously oppressed by the capitalists, they had been starved and flogged, women had been forced to work in the coal mines (women still did work in the coal mines, as a matter of fact), children had been sold into the factories at the age of six., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but simultaneously, true to the principles of doublethink, the party taught that the proles were natural inferiors who must be kept in subjection, like animals, by the application of a few simple rules., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in reality very little was known about the proles., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not necessary to know much., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so long as they continued to work and breed, their other activities were without importance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [left to themselves, like cattle turned loose upon the plains of argentina, they had reverted to a style of life that appeared to be natural to them, a sort of ancestral pattern., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were born, they grew up in the gutters, they went to work at twelve, they passed through a brief blossoming-period of beauty and sexual desire, they married at twenty, they were middle-aged at thirty, they died, for the most part, at sixty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [heavy physical work, the care of home and children, petty quarrels with neighbours, films, football, beer, and above all, gambling, filled up the horizon of their minds., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to keep them in control was not difficult., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a few agents of the thought police moved always among them, spreading false rumours and marking down and eliminating the few individuals who were judged capable of becoming dangerous; but no attempt was made to indoctrinate them with the ideology of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the larger evils invariably escaped their notice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the great majority of proles did not even have telescreens in their homes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the civil police interfered with them very little., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a vast amount of criminality in london, a whole world-within-a-world of thieves, bandits, prostitutes, drug-peddlers, and racketeers of every description; but since it all happened among the proles themselves, it was of no importance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in all questions of morals they were allowed to follow their ancestral code., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sexual puritanism of the party was not imposed upon them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [promiscuity went unpunished, divorce was permitted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for that matter, even religious worship would have been permitted if the proles had shown any sign of needing or wanting it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were beneath suspicion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as the party slogan put it: 'proles and animals are free.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had begun itching again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thing you invariably came back to was the impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been like., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook which he had borrowed from mrs parsons, and began copying a passage into the diary: in the old days (it ran), before the glorious revolution, london was not the beautiful city that we know today., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a dark, dirty, miserable place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to sleep under., 'Orwell', '1984'], [children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and fed them on nothing but stale breadcrusts and water., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in among all this terrible poverty there were just a few great big beautiful houses that were lived in by rich men who had as many as thirty servants to look after them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these rich men were called capitalists., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were fat, ugly men with wicked faces, like the one in the picture on the opposite page., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you can see that he is dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the capitalists owned everything in the world, and everyone else was their slave., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they owned all the land, all the houses, all the factories, and all the money., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if anyone disobeyed them they could throw them into prison, or they could take his job away and starve him to death., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when any ordinary person spoke to a capitalist he had to cringe and bow to him, and take off his cap and address him as 'sir'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the chief of all the capitalists was called the king,, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and---- but he knew the rest of the catalogue., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there would be mention of the bishops in their lawn sleeves, the judges in their ermine robes, the pillory, the stocks, the treadmill, the cat-o'-nine tails, the lord mayor's banquet, and the practice of kissing the pope's toe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was also something called the jus primae noctis, which would probably not be mentioned in a textbook for children., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the law by which every capitalist had the right to sleep with any woman working in one of his factories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [how could you tell how much of it was lies?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it might be true that the average human being was better off now than he had been before the revolution., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the only evidence to the contrary was the mute protest in your own bones, the instinctive feeling that the conditions you lived in were intolerable and that at some other time they must have been different., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it struck him that the truly characteristic thing about modern life was not its cruelty and insecurity, but simply its bareness, its dinginess, its listlessness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [life, if you looked about you, bore no resemblance not only to the lies that streamed out of the telescreens, but even to the ideals that the party was trying to achieve., 'Orwell', '1984'], [great areas of it, even for a party member, were neutral and non-political, a matter of slogging through dreary jobs, fighting for a place on the tube, darning a worn-out sock, cadging a saccharine tablet, saving a cigarette end., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ideal set up by the party was something huge, terrible, and glittering--a world of steel and concrete, of monstrous machines and terrifying weapons--a nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he seemed to see a vision of london, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it was a picture of mrs parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair, fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he reached down and scratched his ankle again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [day and night the telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger, happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [not a word of it could ever be proved or disproved., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party claimed, for example, that today 40 per cent of adult proles were literate: before the revolution, it was said, the number had only been 15 per cent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party claimed that the infant mortality rate was now only 160 per thousand, whereas before the revolution it had been 300--and, 'Orwell', '1984'], [so it went on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was like a single equation with two unknowns., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it might very well be that literally every word in the history books, even the things that one accepted without question, was pure fantasy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for all he knew there might never have been any such law as the jus primae noctis, or any such creature as a capitalist, or any such garment as a top hat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everything faded into mist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the past was erased, the erasure was forgotten, the lie became truth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [just once in his life he had possessed--after the event: that was what counted--concrete, unmistakable evidence of an act of falsification., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had held it between his fingers for as long as thirty seconds., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in 1973, it must have been--at any rate, it was at about the time when he and katharine had parted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the really relevant date was seven or eight years earlier., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the story really began in the middle sixties, the period of the great purges in which the original leaders of the revolution were wiped out once and for all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by 1970 none of them was left, except big brother himself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all the rest had by that time been exposed as traitors and counter-revolutionaries., 'Orwell', '1984'], [goldstein had fled and was hiding no one knew where, and of the others, a few had simply disappeared, while the majority had been executed after spectacular public trials at which they made confession of their crimes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [among the last survivors were three men named jones, aaronson, and rutherford., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it must have been in 1965 that these three had been arrested., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as often happened, they had vanished for a year or more, so that one did not know whether they were alive or dead, and then had suddenly been brought forth to incriminate themselves in the usual way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they had confessed to intelligence with the enemy (at that date, too, the enemy was eurasia), embezzlement of public funds, the murder of various trusted party members, intrigues against the leadership of big brother which had started long before the revolution happened, and acts of sabotage causing the death of hundreds of thousands of people., 'Orwell', '1984'], [after confessing to these things they had been pardoned, reinstated in the party, and given posts which were in fact sinecures but which sounded important., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all three had written long, abject articles in 'the times', analysing the reasons for their defection and promising to make amends., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some time after their release winston had actually seen all three of them in the chestnut tree cafe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered the sort of terrified fascination with which he had watched them out of the corner of his eye., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were men far older than himself, relics of the ancient world, almost the last great figures left over from the heroic days of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the glamour of the underground struggle and the civil war still faintly clung to them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had the feeling, though already at that time facts and dates were growing blurry, that he had known their names years earlier than he had known that of big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but also they were outlaws, enemies, untouchables, doomed with absolute certainty to extinction within a year or two., 'Orwell', '1984'], [no one who had once fallen into the hands of the thought police ever escaped in the end., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were corpses waiting to be sent back to the grave., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no one at any of the tables nearest to them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not wise even to be seen in the neighbourhood of such people., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were sitting in silence before glasses of the gin flavoured with cloves which was the speciality of the cafe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of the three, it was rutherford whose appearance had most impressed winston., 'Orwell', '1984'], [rutherford had once been a famous caricaturist, whose brutal cartoons had helped to inflame popular opinion before and during the revolution., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even now, at long intervals, his cartoons were appearing in the times., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were simply an imitation of his earlier manner, and curiously lifeless and unconvincing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [always they were a rehashing of the ancient themes--slum tenements, starving children, street battles, capitalists in top hats--even on the barricades the capitalists still seemed to cling to their top hats an endless, hopeless effort to get back into the past., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was a monstrous man, with a mane of greasy grey hair, his face pouched and seamed, with thick negroid lips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at one time he must have been immensely strong; now his great body was sagging, sloping, bulging, falling away in every direction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he seemed to be breaking up before one's eyes, like a mountain crumbling., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the lonely hour of fifteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston could not now remember how he had come to be in the cafe at such a time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the place was almost empty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a tinny music was trickling from the telescreens., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the three men sat in their corner almost motionless, never speaking., 'Orwell', '1984'], [uncommanded, the waiter brought fresh glasses of gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a chessboard on the table beside them, with the pieces set out but no game started., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and then, for perhaps half a minute in all, something happened to the telescreens., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the tune that they were playing changed, and the tone of the music changed too., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there came into it--but it was something hard to describe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a peculiar, cracked, braying, jeering note: in his mind winston called it a yellow note., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and then a voice from the telescreen was singing: under the spreading chestnut tree i sold you and you sold me: there lie they, and here lie we under the spreading chestnut tree., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the three men never stirred., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but when winston glanced again at rutherford's ruinous face, he saw that his eyes were full of tears., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and for the first time he noticed, with a kind of inward shudder, and yet not knowing at what he shuddered, that both aaronson and rutherford had broken noses., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a little later all three were re-arrested., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it appeared that they had engaged in fresh conspiracies from the very moment of their release., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at their second trial they confessed to all their old crimes over again, with a whole string of new ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were executed, and their fate was recorded in the party histories, a warning to posterity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [about five years after this, in 1973, winston was unrolling a wad of documents which had just flopped out of the pneumatic tube on to his desk when he came on a fragment of paper which had evidently been slipped in among the others and then forgotten., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the instant he had flattened it out, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he saw its significance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a half-page torn out of 'the times' of about ten years earlier--the top half of the page, so that it included the date--and it contained a photograph of the delegates at some party function in new york., 'Orwell', '1984'], [prominent in the middle of the group were jones, aaronson, and rutherford., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no mistaking them, in any case their names were in the caption at the bottom., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the point was that at both trials all three men had confessed that on that date they had been on eurasian soil., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they had flown from a secret airfield in canada to a rendezvous somewhere in siberia, and had conferred with members of the eurasian general staff, to whom they had betrayed important military secrets., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the date had stuck in winston's memory because it chanced to be midsummer day; but the whole story must be on record in countless other places as well., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was only one possible conclusion: the confessions were lies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course, this was not in itself a discovery., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even at that time winston had not imagined that the people who were wiped out in the purges had actually committed the crimes that they were accused of., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this was concrete evidence; it was a fragment of the abolished past, like a fossil bone which turns up in the wrong stratum and destroys a geological theory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was enough to blow the party to atoms, if in some way it could have been published to the world and its significance made known., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had gone straight on working., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as soon as he saw what the photograph was, and what it meant, he had covered it up with another sheet of paper., 'Orwell', '1984'], [luckily, when he unrolled it, it had been upside-down from the point of view of the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took his scribbling pad on his knee and pushed back his chair so as to get as far away from the telescreen as possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to keep your face expressionless was not difficult, and even your breathing could be controlled, with an effort: but you could not control the beating of your heart, and the telescreen was quite delicate enough to pick it up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he let what he judged to be ten minutes go by, tormented all the while by the fear that some accident--a sudden draught blowing across his desk, for instance--would betray him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then, without uncovering it again, he dropped the photograph into the memory hole, along with some other waste papers., 'Orwell', '1984'], [within another minute, perhaps, it would have crumbled into ashes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that was ten--eleven years ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [today, probably, he would have kept that photograph., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was curious that the fact of having held it in his fingers seemed to him to make a difference even now, when the photograph itself, as well as the event it recorded, was only memory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [was the party's hold upon the past less strong, he wondered, because a piece of evidence which existed no longer had once existed?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [but today, supposing that it could be somehow resurrected from its ashes, the photograph might not even be evidence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [already, at the time when he made his discovery, oceania was no longer at war with eurasia, and it must have been to the agents of eastasia that the three dead men had betrayed their country., 'Orwell', '1984'], [since then there had been other changes--two, three, he could not remember how many., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very likely the confessions had been rewritten and rewritten until the original facts and dates no longer had the smallest significance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the past not only changed, but changed continuously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what most afflicted him with the sense of nightmare was that he had never clearly understood why the huge imposture was undertaken., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the immediate advantages of falsifying the past were obvious, but the ultimate motive was mysterious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took up his pen again and wrote: i understand how: i do not understand why., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wondered, as he had many times wondered before, whether he himself was a lunatic., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps a lunatic was simply a minority of one., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at one time it had been a sign of madness to believe that the earth goes round the sun; today, to believe that the past is unalterable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he might be alone in holding that belief, and if alone, then a lunatic., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the thought of being a lunatic did not greatly trouble him: the horror was that he might also be wrong., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he picked up the children's history book and looked at the portrait of big brother which formed its frontispiece., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the hypnotic eyes gazed into his own., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was as though some huge force were pressing down upon you--something that penetrated inside your skull, battering against your brain, frightening you out of your beliefs, persuading you, almost, to deny the evidence of your senses., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the end the party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was inevitable that they should make that claim sooner or later: the logic of their position demanded it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [not merely the validity of experience, but the very existence of external reality, was tacitly denied by their philosophy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the heresy of heresies was common sense., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and what was terrifying was not that they would kill you for thinking otherwise, but that they might be right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for, after all, how do we know that two and two make four? or that the force of gravity works? or that the past is unchangeable?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [if both the past and the external world exist only in the mind, and if the mind itself is controllable what then?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [but no!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [his courage seemed suddenly to stiffen of its own accord., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the face of o'brien, not called up by any obvious association, had floated into his mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew, with more certainty than before, that o'brien was on his side., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was writing the diary for o'brien--to o'brien: it was like an interminable letter which no one would ever read, but which was addressed to a particular person and took its colour from that fact., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was their final, most essential command., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his heart sank as he thought of the enormous power arrayed against him, the ease with which any party intellectual would overthrow him in debate, the subtle arguments which he would not be able to understand, much less answer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and yet he was in the right!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were wrong and he was right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended., 'Orwell', '1984'], [truisms are true, hold on to that!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the solid world exists, its laws do not change., 'Orwell', '1984'], [stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth's centre., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the feeling that he was speaking to o'brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if that is granted, all else follows.  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [from somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee--real coffee, not victory coffee--came floating out into the street., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston paused involuntarily., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for perhaps two seconds he was back in the half-forgotten world of his childhood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then a door banged, seeming to cut off the smell as abruptly as though it had been a sound., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the community centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the centre was carefully checked., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in principle a party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was assumed that when he was not working, eating, or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a word for it in newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this evening as he came out of the ministry the balminess of the april air had tempted him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of london, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.

buy the picture., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not weeks--as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shop-front--but charrington., 'Orwell', '1984'], [mr charrington, 'Orwell', '1984'], [, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [throughout that

up his mind that after a suitable interval--a month, say--he would take the risk of visiting the shop again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was perhaps not more dangerous than shirking an evening at the centre., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the serious piece of folly had been to come back here in the first place, after buying the diary and without knowing whether the proprietor of the shop could be trusted.,

made him careless, and he stepped out on to the pavement without so much as a preliminary glance through the window., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had even started humming to an improvised tune oranges and lemons, say the bells of st clement's, you owe me three farthings, say the---- suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a figure in blue overalls was coming down the pavement, not ten metres away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the girl from the fiction department, the girl with dark hair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the light was failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as though she had not seen him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a few seconds winston was too paralysed to move., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong direction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at any rate, one question was settled., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she must have followed him here, because it was not credible that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet, kilometres distant from any quarter where party members lived., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was too great a coincidence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whether she was really an agent of the thought police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was enough that she was watching him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [probably she had seen him go into the pub as well., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was an effort to walk., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the lump of glass in his pocket banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded to take it out and throw it away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the worst thing was the pain in his belly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a couple of minutes he had the feeling that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the street was a blind alley., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston halted, stood for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then turned round and began to retrace his steps., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could not run, he could not strike a blow., 'Orwell', '1984'], [besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought also of hurrying to the community centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but that too was impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a deadly lassitude had taken hold of him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all he wanted was to get home quickly and then sit down and be quiet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of victory gin., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down, and took the diary out of the drawer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but he did not open it at once., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was at night that they came for you, always at night., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [undoubtedly some people did so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [many of the disappearances were actually suicides., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one's own body., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he opened the diary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was important to write something down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the woman on the telescreen had started a new song., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he tried to think of o'brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the thought police took him away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would not matter if they killed you at once., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to be killed was what you expected., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of o'brien. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [we shall meet in the place where there is no darkness,' o'brien had said to him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew what it meant, or thought he knew., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he put a cigarette in his mouth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [half the tobacco promptly fell out on to his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the face of big brother swam into his mind, displacing that of o'brien., 'Orwell', '1984'], [just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [like a leaden knell the words came back at him: war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength part two  , 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the middle of the morning, and winston had left the cubicle to go to the lavatory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the girl with dark hair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls., 'Orwell', '1984'], [probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were 'roughed in'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a common accident in the fiction department., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she must have fallen right on the injured arm., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston stopped short., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl had risen to her knees., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a curious emotion stirred in winston's heart., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [already he had instinctively started forward to help her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [you're hurt?', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he said., 'Orwell', '1984'], ['it's nothing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [my arm., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it'll be all right in a second.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she spoke as though her heart were fluttering., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had certainly turned very pale. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [you haven't broken anything?' ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [no, i'm all right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it hurt for a moment, that's all.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had regained some of her colour, and appeared very much better. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [it's nothing,' she repeated shortly. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i only gave my wrist a bit of a bang., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thanks, comrade!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute., 'Orwell', '1984'], [not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no question that she had done it intentionally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was something small and flat. as he passed through the lavatory door, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a scrap of paper folded into a square., 'Orwell', '1984'], [while he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded., 'Orwell', '1984'], [obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it at once., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but that would be shocking folly, as he well knew., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [five minutes,' he told himself, 'five minutes at the very least!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [his heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political meaning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so far as he could see there were two possibilities., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the thought police, just as he had feared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not know why the thought police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was, that the message did not come from the thought police at all, but from some kind of underground organization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps the brotherhood existed after all!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [perhaps the girl was part of it!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [no doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not till a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death--still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube., 'Orwell', '1984'], [eight minutes had gone by., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on top of it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he flattened it out., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on it was written, in a large unformed handwriting: i love you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when he did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to make sure that the words were really there., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he felt as though a fire were burning in his belly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of big brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of spies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the irritating thing was that in the racket of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the afternoon was more bearable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the inner party, who was now under a cloud., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was the kind of thing that winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. until he could be alone, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was impossible to think this new development out., 'Orwell', '1984'], [tonight was one of his nights at the community centre., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a 'discussion group', played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin, and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled 'ingsoc in relation to chess'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the centre., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at the sight of the words i love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed--in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent--that he was able to think continuously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note., 'Orwell', '1984'], [obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone, but that was of no importance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [what he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if she had worked in the records department it might have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the fiction department lay, and he had no pretext for going there., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the ministry, which was bound to be noticed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually, few people ever wrote letters., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in any case he did not know the girl's name, let alone her address., 'Orwell', '1984'], [finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round, 'Orwell', '1984'], [--if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a week after this, life was like a restless dream., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown., 'Orwell', '1984'], [presumably she had been changed on to a later shift., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they passed each other without a glance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not touch the diary during those days., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no enquiry he could make., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she might have been vaporized, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the next day she reappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking-plaster round her wrist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was early, and the place was not very full., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the queue edged forward till winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the girl was still alone when winston secured his tray and began to make for her table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was perhaps three metres away from him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [another two seconds would do it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then a voice behind him called, 'smith!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he pretended not to hear. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [smith!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [repeated the voice, more loudly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was no use., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he turned round., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a blond-headed, silly-faced young man named wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not safe to refuse., 'Orwell', '1984'], [after having been recognized, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was too noticeable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat down with a friendly smile., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the silly blond face beamed into his., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pick-axe right into the middle of it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl's table filled up a few minutes later., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take the hint., 'Orwell', '1984'], [next day he took care to arrive early., 'Orwell', '1984'], [surely enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl's table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his hopes sank again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with ice at his heart winston followed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was no use unless he could get the girl alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at this moment there was a tremendous crash., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he started to his feet with a malignant glance at winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it was all right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [five seconds later, with a thundering heart, winston was sitting at the girl's table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not look at her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he unpacked his tray and promptly began eating., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a week had gone by since she had first approached him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not happen in real life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in his vague way ampleforth was attached to winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was perhaps a minute in which to act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [both winston and the girl were eating steadily., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in a low murmur winston began speaking., 'Orwell', '1984'], [neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices.

'what time?' 'nineteen hours.' ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [all right.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [ampleforth failed to see winston and sat down at another table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they did not speak again, and, so far as it was possible for two people sitting on opposite sides of the same table, they did not look at one another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl finished her lunch quickly and made off, while winston stayed to smoke a cigarette., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston was in victory square before the appointed time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which big brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the eurasian aeroplanes (the eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the battle of airstrip one., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent oliver cromwell., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [again the terrible fear seized upon winston., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was not coming, she had changed her mind!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying st martin's church, whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed 'you owe me three farthings.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were telescreens all round the pediment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston followed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of eurasian prisoners was passing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd., 'Orwell', '1984'], [soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was next to the girl., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together., 'Orwell', '1984'], [their sad, mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks utterly incurious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons., 'Orwell', '1984'], [truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston knew they were there, 'Orwell', '1984'], [but he saw them only intermittently., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the girl's shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.

good-bye!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even now he had not found out her surname or her address., 'Orwell', '1984'], [however, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as it happened, they never went back to the clearing in the wood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [during the month of may there was only one further occasion on which they actually succeeded in making love., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that was in another hiding-place known to julia, the belfry of a ruinous church in an almost-deserted stretch of country where an atomic bomb had fallen thirty years earlier., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a good hiding-place when once you got there, but the getting there was very dangerous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the rest they could meet only in the streets, in a different place every evening and never for more than half an hour at a time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the street it was usually possible to talk, after a fashion. as they drifted down the crowded pavements, not quite abreast and never looking at one another, they carried on a curious, intermittent conversation which flicked on and off like the beams of a lighthouse, suddenly nipped into silence by the approach of a party uniform or the proximity of a telescreen, then taken up again minutes later in the middle of a sentence, then abruptly cut short as they parted at the agreed spot, then continued almost without introduction on the following day., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia appeared to be quite used to this kind of conversation, which she called 'talking by instalments'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was also surprisingly adept at speaking without moving her lips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [just once in almost a month of nightly meetings they managed to exchange a kiss., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they were passing in silence down, 'Orwell', '1984'], [a side-street (julia would never speak when they were away from the main streets) when there was a deafening roar, the earth heaved, and the air darkened, and winston found himself lying on his side, bruised and terrified., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a rocket bomb must have dropped quite near at hand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly he became aware of julia's face a few centimetres from his own, deathly white, as white as chalk., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even her lips were white., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was dead!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he clasped her against him and found that he was kissing a live warm face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there was some powdery stuff that got in the way of his lips., 'Orwell', '1984'], [both of their faces were thickly coated with plaster., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston's working week was sixty hours, julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior anti-sex league, preparing banners for hate week, making collections for the savings campaign, and such-like activities., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it paid, she said, it was camouflage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she even induced winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous party members., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so, one evening every week, winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a blazing afternoon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia was twenty-six years old., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she lived in a hostel with thirty other girls ('always in the stink of women!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [how i hate women!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [she said parenthetically), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the fiction department., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was 'not clever', but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the planning committee down to the final touching-up by the rewrite squad., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but she was not interested in the finished product., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she 'didn't much care for reading,' she said., 'Orwell', '1984'], [books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had no memories of anything before the early sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had been a troop-leader in the spies and a branch secretary in the youth league before joining the junior anti-sex league., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had always borne an excellent character., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had even (an infallible mark of good reputation, 'Orwell', '1984'], [) been picked out to work in pornosec, the sub-section of the fiction department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was nicknamed muck house by the people who worked in it, she remarked., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like 'spanking stories' or 'one night in a girls' school', to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [what are these books like?' said winston curiously. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [oh, ghastly rubbish., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they're boring, really., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of course i was only on the kaleidoscopes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i was never in the rewrite squad., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i'm not literary, dear--not even enough for that.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he learned with astonishment that all the workers in pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [they don't even like having married women there,' she added., 'Orwell', '1984'], [girls are always supposed to be so pure., 'Orwell', '1984'], [here's one who isn't, anyway., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [and a good job too,' said julia, 'otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [since then there had been various others., 'Orwell', '1984'], [life as she saw it was quite simple., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you wanted a good time; 'they', meaning the party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she seemed to think it just as natural that 'they' should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she hated the party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in party doctrine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he noticed that she never used newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had never heard of the brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [any kind of organized revolt against the party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the party as something unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they did not discuss the possibility of getting married., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was too remote to be worth thinking about., 'Orwell', '1984'], [no imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if katharine, winston's wife, could somehow have been got rid of., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was hopeless even as a daydream.

', 'Orwell', '1984'], [no, i didn't know the word, but i know the kind of person, right enough.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things: katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing,' he said., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he told her about the frigid little ceremony that katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week.

be arrested., 'Orwell', '1984'], [often they gave themselves up to daydreams of escape., 'Orwell', '1984'], [their luck would hold indefinitely, and they would carry on their intrigue, just like this,

'1984'], [he told her of the strange intimacy that existed, or seemed to exist, between himself and o'brien, and of the impulse he sometimes felt, simply to walk into o'brien's presence, announce that he was the enemy of the party, and demand his help., 'Orwell', '1984'], [curiously enough, this did not strike her as an impossibly rash thing to do., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was used to judging people by their faces, and it seemed natural to her that winston should believe o'brien to be trustworthy on the strength of a single flash of the eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [moreover she took it for granted that everyone, or nearly everyone, secretly hated the party and would break the rules if he thought it safe to do so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but she refused to believe that widespread, organized opposition existed or could exist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the tales about goldstein and his underground army, she said, were simply a lot of rubbish which the party had invented for its own purposes and which you had to pretend to believe in., 'Orwell', '1984'], [times beyond number, at party rallies and spontaneous demonstrations, she had shouted at the top of her voice for the execution of people whose names she had never heard and in whose supposed crimes she had not the faintest belief., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when public trials were happening she had taken her place in the detachments from the youth league who surrounded the courts from morning to night, chanting at intervals 'death to the traitors!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [during the two minutes hate she always excelled all others in shouting insults at goldstein., 'Orwell', '1984'], [yet she had only the dimmest idea of who goldstein was and what doctrines he was supposed to represent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she had grown up since the revolution and was too young to remember the ideological battles of the fifties and sixties., 'Orwell', '1984'], [such a thing as an independent political movement was outside her imagination: and in any case the party was invincible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would always exist, and it would always be the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you could only rebel against it by secret disobedience or, at most, by isolated acts of violence such as killing somebody or blowing something up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in some ways she was far more acute than winston, and far less susceptible to party propaganda., 'Orwell', '1984'], [once when he happened in some connexion to mention the war against eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that in her opinion the war was not happening., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the rocket bombs which fell daily on london were probably fired by the government of oceania itself, 'just to keep people frightened'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was an idea that had literally never occurred to him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she also stirred a sort of envy in him by telling him that during the two minutes hate her great difficulty was to avoid bursting out laughing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but she only questioned the teachings of the party when they in some way touched upon her own life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [often she was ready to accept the official mythology, simply because the difference between truth and falsehood did not seem important to her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she believed, for instance, having learnt it at school, that the party had invented aeroplanes.,

julia was at school, it was already claiming the aeroplane; one generation more, and it would be claiming the steam engine.) and when he told her that aeroplanes had been in existence before he was born and long before the revolution, the fact struck her as totally uninteresting., 'Orwell', '1984'], [after all, what did it matter who had invented aeroplanes?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was rather more of a shock to him when he discovered from some chance remark that she did not remember that oceania, four years ago, had been at war with eastasia and at peace with eurasia., 'Orwell', '1984'],

massed planes, the booming of guns--after six days of this, when the great orgasm was quivering to its climax and the general hatred of eurasia had boiled up into such delirium that if the crowd could

[one minute more, and the feral roars of rage were again bursting from the crowd., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the hate continued exactly as before, except that the target had been changed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the thing that impressed winston in looking back was that the speaker had switched from one line to the other actually in midsentence, not only without a pause, but without even breaking the syntax., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but at the moment he had other things to preoccupy him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was during the moment of disorder while the posters were being torn down that a man whose face he did not see had tapped him on the shoulder and said, 'excuse me, i think you've dropped your brief-case.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he took the brief-case abstractedly, without speaking., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew that it would be days before he had an opportunity to look inside it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the instant that the demonstration was over he went straight to the ministry of truth, though the time was now nearly twenty-three hours., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the entire staff of the ministry had done likewise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the orders already issuing from the telescreen, recalling them to their posts, were hardly necessary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceania was at war with eastasia: oceania had always been at war with eastasia., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete., 'Orwell', '1984'], [reports and records of all kinds, newspapers, books, pamphlets, films, sound-tracks, photographs--all had to be rectified at lightning speed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [although no directive was ever issued, it was known that the chiefs of the department intended that within one week no reference to the war with eurasia, or the alliance with eastasia, should remain in existence anywhere., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the work was overwhelming, all the more so because the processes that it involved could not be called by their true names., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everyone in the records department worked eighteen hours in the twenty-four, with two three-hour snatches of sleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [mattresses were brought up from the cellars and pitched all over the corridors: meals consisted of sandwiches and victory coffee wheeled round on trolleys by attendants from the canteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [each time that winston broke off for one of his spells of sleep he tried to leave his desk clear of work, and each time that he crawled back sticky-eyed and aching, it was to find that another shower of paper cylinders had covered the desk like a snowdrift, half-burying the speakwrite and overflowing on to the floor, so that the first job was always to stack them into a neat enough pile to give him room to work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what was worst of all was that the work was by no means purely mechanical., 'Orwell', '1984'], [often it was enough merely to substitute one name for another, but any detailed report of events demanded care and imagination., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the geographical knowledge that one needed in transferring the war from one part of the world to another was considerable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by the third day his eyes ached unbearably and his spectacles needed wiping every few minutes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was like struggling with some crushing physical task, something which one had the right to refuse and which one was nevertheless neurotically anxious to accomplish., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in so far as he had time to remember it, he was not troubled by the fact that every word he murmured into the speakwrite, every stroke of his ink-pencil, was a deliberate lie., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was as anxious as anyone else in the department that the forgery should be perfect., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the morning of the sixth day the dribble of cylinders slowed down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for as much as half an hour nothing came out of the tube; then one more cylinder, then nothing. everywhere at about the same time the work was easing off., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a deep and as it were secret sigh went through the department., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a mighty deed, which could never be mentioned, had been achieved., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was now impossible for any human being to prove by documentary evidence that the war with eurasia had ever happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at twelve hundred it was unexpectedly announced that all workers in the ministry were free till tomorrow morning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston, still carrying the brief-case containing the book, which had remained between his feet while he worked and under his body while he slept, went home, shaved himself, and almost fell asleep in his bath, although the water was barely more than tepid., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with a sort of voluptuous creaking in his joints he climbed the stair above mr charrington's shop., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was tired, but not sleepy any longer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he opened the window, lit the dirty little oilstove and put on a pan of water for coffee., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia would arrive presently: meanwhile there was the book., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he sat down in the sluttish armchair and undid the straps of the brief-case., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a heavy black volume, amateurishly bound, with no name or title on the cover., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the print also looked slightly irregular., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the pages were worn at the edges, and fell apart, easily, as though the book had passed through many hands., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the inscription on the title-page ran: the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism by emmanuel goldstein winston began reading: chapter i ignorance is strength throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the neolithic age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the high, the middle, and the low., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the aims of these groups are entirely irreconcilable..., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston stopped reading, chiefly in order to appreciate the fact that he was reading, in comfort and safety., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was alone:, 'Orwell', '1984'], [no telescreen, no ear at the keyhole, no nervous impulse to glance over his shoulder or cover the page with his hand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sweet summer air played against his cheek., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from somewhere far away there floated the faint shouts of children: in the room itself there was no sound except the insect voice of the clock., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he settled deeper into the arm-chair and put his feet up on the fender., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was bliss, it was eternity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly, as one sometimes does with a book of which one knows that one will ultimately read and re-read every word, he opened it at a different place and found himself at chapter iii., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he went on reading:, 'Orwell', '1984'], [chapter iii war is peace the splitting up of the world into three great super-states was an event which could be and indeed was foreseen before the middle of the twentieth century., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the absorption of europe by russia and of the british empire by the united states, two of the three existing powers, eurasia and oceania, were already effectively in being., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the third, eastasia, only emerged as a distinct unit after another decade of confused fighting., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the frontiers between the three super-states are in some places arbitrary, and in others they fluctuate according to the fortunes of war, but in general they follow geographical lines., 'Orwell', '1984'], [eurasia comprises the whole of the northern part of the european and asiatic land-mass, from portugal to the bering strait., 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceania comprises the americas, the atlantic islands including the british isles, australasia, and the southern portion of africa., 'Orwell', '1984'], [eastasia, smaller than the others and with a less definite western frontier, comprises china and the countries to the south of it, the japanese islands and a large but fluctuating portion of manchuria, mongolia, and tibet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in one combination or another, these three super-states are permanently at war, and have been so for the past twenty-five years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war, however, is no longer the desperate, annihilating struggle that it was in the early decades of the twentieth century., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is a warfare of limited aims between combatants who are unable to destroy one another, have no material cause for fighting and are not divided by any genuine ideological difference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this is not to say that either the conduct of war, or the prevailing attitude towards it, has become less bloodthirsty or more chivalrous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the contrary, war hysteria is continuous and universal in all countries, and such acts as raping, looting, the slaughter of children, the reduction of whole populations to slavery, and reprisals against prisoners which extend even to boiling and burying alive, are looked upon as normal, and, when they are committed by one's own side and not by the enemy, meritorious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in a physical sense war involves very small numbers of people, mostly highly-trained specialists, and causes comparatively few casualties., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at, or round the floating fortresses which guard strategic spots on the sea lanes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the centres of civilization war means no more than a continuous shortage of consumption goods, and the occasional crash of a rocket bomb which may cause a few scores of deaths., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war has in fact changed its character., 'Orwell', '1984'], [more exactly, the reasons for which war is waged have changed in their order of importance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [motives which were already present to some small extent in the great wars of the early twentieth century have now become dominant and are consciously recognized and acted upon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to understand the nature of the present war--for in spite of the regrouping which occurs every few years, it is always the same war--one must realize in the first place that it is impossible for it to be decisive., 'Orwell', '1984'], [none of the three super-states could be definitively conquered even by the other two in combination., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they are too evenly matched, and their natural defences are too formidable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [eurasia is protected by its vast land spaces, oceania by the width of the atlantic and the pacific, eastasia by the fecundity and industriousness of its inhabitants., 'Orwell', '1984'], [secondly, there is no longer, in a material sense, anything to fight about., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the establishment of self-contained economies, in which production and consumption are geared to one another, the scramble for markets which was a main cause of previous wars has come to an end, while the competition for raw materials is no longer a matter of life and death., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in any case each of the three super-states is so vast that it can obtain almost all the materials that it needs within its own boundaries., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in so far as the war has a direct economic purpose, it is a war for labour power., 'Orwell', '1984'], [between the frontiers of the super-states, and not permanently in the possession of any of them, there lies a rough quadrilateral with its corners at tangier, brazzaville, darwin, and hong kong, containing within it about a fifth of the population of the earth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is for the possession of these thickly-populated regions, and of the northern ice-cap, that the three powers are constantly struggling., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in practice no one power ever controls the whole of the disputed area., 'Orwell', '1984'], [portions of it are constantly changing hands, and it is the chance of seizing this or that fragment by a sudden stroke of treachery that dictates the endless changes of alignment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all of the disputed territories contain valuable minerals, and some of them yield important vegetable products such as rubber which in colder climates it is necessary to synthesize by comparatively expensive methods., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but above all they contain a bottomless reserve of cheap labour., 'Orwell', '1984'], [whichever power controls equatorial africa, or the countries of the middle east, or southern india, or the indonesian archipelago, disposes also of the bodies of scores or hundreds of millions of ill-paid and hard-working coolies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the inhabitants of these areas, reduced more or less openly to the status of slaves, pass continually from conqueror to conqueror, and are expended like so much coal or oil in the race to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, to control more labour power, to turn out more armaments, to capture more territory, and so on indefinitely., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it should be noted that the fighting never really moves beyond the edges of the disputed areas., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the frontiers of eurasia flow back and forth between the basin of the congo and the northern shore of the mediterranean; the islands of the indian ocean and the pacific are constantly being captured and recaptured by oceania or by eastasia; in mongolia the dividing line between eurasia and eastasia is never stable; round the pole all three powers lay claim to enormous territories which in fact are largely uninhabited and unexplored: but the balance of power always remains roughly even, and the territory which forms the heartland of each super-state always remains inviolate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [moreover, the labour of the exploited peoples round the equator is not really necessary to the world's economy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they add nothing to the wealth of the world, since whatever they produce is used for purposes of war, and the object of waging a war is always to be in a better position in which to wage another war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by their labour the slave populations allow the tempo of continuous warfare to be speeded up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but if they did not exist, the structure of world society, and the process by which it maintains itself, would not be essentially different., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the inner party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the world of today is a bare, hungry, dilapidated place compared with the world that existed before 1914, and still more so if compared with the imaginary future to which the people of that period looked forward., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the early twentieth century, the vision of a future society unbelievably rich, leisured, orderly, and efficient--a glittering antiseptic world of glass and steel and snow-white concrete--was part of the consciousness of nearly every literate person., 'Orwell', '1984'], [science and technology were developing at a prodigious speed, and it seemed natural to assume that they would go on developing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this failed to happen, partly because of the impoverishment caused by a long series of wars and revolutions, partly because scientific and technical progress depended on the empirical habit of thought, which could not survive in a strictly regimented society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as a whole the world is more primitive today than it was fifty years ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [certain backward areas have advanced, and various devices, always in some way connected with warfare and police espionage, have been developed, but experiment and invention have largely stopped, and the ravages of the atomic war of the nineteen-fifties have never been fully repaired., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nevertheless the dangers inherent in the machine are still there., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process--by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute--the machine did raise the living standards of the average human being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction--indeed, in some sense was the destruction--of a hierarchical society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in practice such a society could not long remain stable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by state charity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world., 'Orwell', '1984'], [goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a floating fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another floating fortress is built., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the inner party lives an austere, laborious kind of life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter--set him in a different world from a member of the outer party, and the members of the outer party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call 'the proles'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war, it will be seen, accomplishes the necessary destruction, but accomplishes it in a psychologically acceptable way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in principle it would be quite simple to waste the surplus labour of the world by building temples and pyramids, by digging holes and filling them up again, or even by producing vast quantities of goods and then setting fire to them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this would provide only the economic and not the emotional basis for a hierarchical society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what is concerned here is not the morale of masses, whose attitude is unimportant so long as they are kept steadily at work, but the morale of the party itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the humblest party member is expected to be competent, industrious, and even intelligent within narrow limits, but it is also necessary that he should be a credulous and ignorant fanatic whose prevailing moods are fear, hatred, adulation, and orgiastic triumph., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in other words it is necessary that he should have the mentality appropriate to a state of war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it does not matter whether the war is actually happening, and, since no decisive victory is possible, it does not matter whether the war is going well or badly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that is needed is that a state of war should exist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the splitting of the intelligence which the party requires of its members, and which is more easily achieved in an atmosphere of war, is now almost universal, but the higher up the ranks one goes, the more marked it becomes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is precisely in the inner party that war hysteria and hatred of the enemy are strongest., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in his capacity as an administrator, it is often necessary for a member of the inner party to know that this or that item of war news is untruthful, and he may often be aware that the entire war is spurious and is either not happening or is being waged for purposes quite other than the declared ones: but such knowledge is easily neutralized by the technique of doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [meanwhile no inner party member wavers for an instant in his mystical belief that the war is real, and that it is bound to end victoriously, with oceania the undisputed master of the entire world., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all members of the inner party believe in this coming conquest as an article of faith., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is to be achieved either by gradually acquiring more and more territory and so building up an overwhelming preponderance of power, or by the discovery of some new and unanswerable weapon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the search for new weapons continues unceasingly, and is one of the very few remaining activities in which the inventive or speculative type of mind can find any outlet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in oceania at the present day, science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in newspeak there is no word for 'science'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the empirical method of thought, on which all the scientific achievements of the past were founded, is opposed to the most fundamental principles of ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and even technological progress only happens when its products can in some way be used for the diminution of human liberty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in all the useful arts the world is either standing still or going backwards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the fields are cultivated with horse-ploughs while books are written by machinery., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in matters of vital importance--meaning, in effect, war and police espionage--the empirical approach is still encouraged, or at least tolerated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the two aims of the party are to conquer the whole surface of the earth and to extinguish once and for all the possibility of independent thought., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there are therefore two great problems which the party is concerned to solve., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one is how to discover, against his will, what another human being is thinking, and the other is how to kill several hundred million people in a few seconds without giving warning beforehand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in so far as scientific research still continues, this is its subject matter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the scientist of today is either a mixture of psychologist and inquisitor, studying with real ordinary minuteness the meaning of facial expressions, gestures, and tones of voice, and testing the truth-producing effects of drugs, shock therapy, hypnosis, and physical torture; or he is chemist, physicist, or biologist concerned only with such branches of his special subject as are relevant to the taking of life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the vast laboratories of the ministry of peace, and in the experimental stations hidden in the brazilian forests, or in the australian desert, or on lost islands of the antarctic, the teams of experts are indefatigably at work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some are concerned simply with planning the logistics of future wars; others devise larger and larger rocket bombs, more and more powerful explosives, and more and more impenetrable armour-plating; others search for new and deadlier gases, or for soluble poisons capable of being produced in such quantities as to destroy the vegetation of whole continents, or for breeds of disease germs immunized against all possible antibodies; others strive to produce a vehicle that shall bore its way under the soil like a submarine under the water, or an aeroplane as independent of its base as a sailing-ship; others explore even remoter possibilities such as focusing the sun's rays through lenses suspended thousands of kilometres away in space, or producing artificial earthquakes and tidal waves by tapping the heat at the earth's centre., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but none of these projects ever comes anywhere near realization, and none of the three super-states ever gains a significant lead on the others., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what is more remarkable is that all three powers already possess, in the atomic bomb, a weapon far more powerful than any that their present researches are likely to discover., 'Orwell', '1984'], [although the party, according to its habit, claims the invention for itself, atomic bombs first appeared as early as the nineteen-forties, and were first used on a large scale about ten years later., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at that time some hundreds of bombs were dropped on industrial centres, chiefly in european russia, western europe, and north america., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the effect was to convince the ruling groups of all countries that a few more atomic bombs would mean the end of organized society, and hence of their own power., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thereafter, although no formal agreement was ever made or hinted at, no more bombs were dropped., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all three powers merely continue to produce atomic bombs and store them up against the decisive opportunity which they all believe will come sooner or later., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and meanwhile the art of war has remained almost stationary for thirty or forty years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [helicopters are more used than they were formerly, bombing planes have been largely superseded by self-propelled projectiles, and the fragile movable battleship has given way to the almost unsinkable floating fortress; but otherwise there has been little development., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the tank, the submarine, the torpedo, the machine gun, even the rifle and the hand grenade are still in use., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in spite of the endless slaughters reported in the press and on the telescreens, the desperate battles of earlier wars, in which hundreds of thousands or even millions of men were often killed in a few weeks, have never been repeated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [none of the three super-states ever attempts any manoeuvre which involves the risk of serious defeat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when any large operation is undertaken, it is usually a surprise attack against an ally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the strategy that all three powers are following, or pretend to themselves that they are following, is the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the plan is, by a combination of fighting, bargaining, and well-timed strokes of treachery, to acquire a ring of bases completely encircling one or other of the rival states, and then to sign a pact of friendship with that rival and remain on peaceful terms for so many years as to lull suspicion to sleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [during this time rockets loaded with atomic bombs can be assembled at all the strategic spots; finally they will all be fired simultaneously, with effects so devastating as to make retaliation impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it will then be time to sign a pact of friendship with the remaining world-power, in preparation for another attack., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this scheme, it is hardly necessary to say, is a mere daydream, impossible of realization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [moreover, no fighting ever occurs except in the disputed areas round the equator and the pole:, 'Orwell', '1984'], [no invasion of enemy territory is ever undertaken., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this explains the fact that in some places the frontiers between the super-states are arbitrary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [eurasia, for example, could easily conquer the british isles, which are geographically part of europe, or on the other hand it would be possible for oceania to push its frontiers to the rhine or even to the vistula., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this would violate the principle, followed on all sides though never formulated, of cultural integrity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if oceania were to conquer the areas that used once to be known as france and germany, it would be necessary either to exterminate the inhabitants, a task of great physical difficulty, or to assimilate a population of about a hundred million people, who, so far as technical development goes, are roughly on the oceanic level., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the problem is the same for all three super-states., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is absolutely necessary to their structure that there should be no contact with foreigners, except, to a limited extent, with war prisoners and coloured slaves., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the official ally of the moment is always regarded with the darkest suspicion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war prisoners apart, the average citizen of oceania never sets eyes on a citizen of either eurasia or eastasia, and he is forbidden the knowledge of foreign languages., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sealed world in which he lives would be broken, and the fear, hatred, and self-righteousness on which his morale depends might evaporate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is therefore realized on all sides that however often persia, or egypt, or java, or ceylon may change hands, the main frontiers must never be crossed by anything except bombs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [under this lies a fact never mentioned aloud, but tacitly understood and acted upon: namely, that the conditions of life in all three super-states are very much the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in oceania the prevailing philosophy is called ingsoc, in eurasia it is called neo-bolshevism, and in eastasia it is called by a chinese name usually translated as death-worship, but perhaps better rendered as obliteration of the self., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the citizen of oceania is not allowed to know anything of the tenets of the other two philosophies, but he is taught to execrate them as barbarous outrages upon morality and common sense., 'Orwell', '1984'], [actually the three philosophies are barely distinguishable, and the social systems which they support are not distinguishable at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [everywhere there is the same pyramidal structure, the same worship of semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous warfare., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it follows that the three super-states not only cannot conquer one another, but would gain no advantage by doing so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the contrary, so long as they remain in conflict they prop one another up, like three sheaves of corn., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and, as usual, the ruling groups of all three powers are simultaneously aware and unaware of what they are doing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [their lives are dedicated to world conquest, but they also know that it is necessary that the war should continue everlastingly and without victory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [meanwhile the fact that there is no danger of conquest makes possible the denial of reality which is the special feature of ingsoc and its rival systems of thought., 'Orwell', '1984'], [here it is necessary to repeat what has been said earlier, that by becoming continuous war has fundamentally changed its character., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in past ages, a war, almost by definition, was something that sooner or later came to an end, usually in unmistakable victory or defeat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the past, also, war was one of the main instruments by which human societies were kept in touch with physical reality., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all rulers in all ages have tried to impose a false view of the world upon their followers, but they could not afford to encourage any illusion that tended to impair military efficiency., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so long as defeat meant the loss of independence, or some other result generally held to be undesirable, the precautions against defeat had to be serious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [physical facts could not be ignored., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in philosophy, or religion, or ethics, or politics, two and two might make five, but when one was designing a gun or an aeroplane they had to make four., 'Orwell', '1984'], [inefficient nations were always conquered sooner or later, and the struggle for efficiency was inimical to illusions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [moreover, to be efficient it was necessary to be able to learn from the past, which meant having a fairly accurate idea of what had happened in the past., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspapers and history books were, of course, always coloured and biased, but falsification of the kind that is practised today would have been impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war was a sure safeguard of sanity, and so far as the ruling classes were concerned it was probably the most important of all safeguards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [while wars could be won or lost, no ruling class could be completely irresponsible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but when war becomes literally continuous, it also ceases to be dangerous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when war is continuous there is no such thing as military necessity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [technical progress can cease and the most palpable facts can be denied or disregarded., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as we have seen, researches that could be called scientific are still carried out for the purposes of war, but they are essentially a kind of daydreaming, and their failure to show results is not important., 'Orwell', '1984'], [efficiency, even military efficiency, is no longer needed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nothing is efficient in oceania except the thought police., 'Orwell', '1984'], [since each of the three super-states is unconquerable, each is in effect a separate universe within which almost any perversion of thought can be safely practised., 'Orwell', '1984'], [reality only exerts its pressure through the needs of everyday life--the need to eat and drink, to get shelter and clothing, to avoid swallowing poison or stepping out of top-storey windows, and the like. between life and death, and between physical pleasure and physical pain, there is still a distinction, but that is all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [cut off from contact with the outer world, and with the past, the citizen of oceania is like a man in interstellar space, who has no way of knowing which direction is up and which is down., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the rulers of such a state are absolute, as the pharaohs or the caesars could not be., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they are obliged to prevent their followers from starving to death in numbers large enough to be inconvenient, and they are obliged to remain at the same low level of military technique as their rivals; but once that minimum is achieved, they can twist reality into whatever shape they choose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the war, therefore, if we judge it by the standards of previous wars, is merely an imposture., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but though it is unreal it is not meaningless., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it eats up the surplus of consumable goods, and it helps to preserve the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [war, it will be seen, is now a purely internal affair., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the past, the ruling groups of all countries, although they might recognize their common interest and therefore limit the destructiveness of war, did fight against one another, and the victor always plundered the vanquished., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in our own day they are not fighting against one another at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the war is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of the war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory, but to keep the structure of society intact., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the very word 'war', therefore, has become misleading., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would probably be accurate to say that by becoming continuous war has ceased to exist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the peculiar pressure that it exerted on human beings between the neolithic age and the early twentieth century has disappeared and been replaced by something quite different., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the effect would be much the same if the three super-states, instead of fighting one another, should agree to live in perpetual peace, each inviolate within its own boundaries., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for in that case each would still be a self-contained universe, freed for ever from the sobering influence of external danger., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a peace that was truly permanent would be the same as a permanent war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this--, 'Orwell', '1984'], [although the vast majority of party members understand it only in a shallower sense--is the inner meaning of the party slogan: war is peace., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston stopped reading for a moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [somewhere in remote distance a rocket bomb thundered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the blissful feeling of being alone with the forbidden book, in a room with no telescreen, had not worn off., 'Orwell', '1984'], [solitude and safety were physical sensations, mixed up somehow with the tiredness of his body, the softness of the chair, the touch of the faint breeze from the window that played upon his cheek., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the book fascinated him, or more exactly it reassured him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in a sense it told him nothing that was new, but that was part of the attraction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it said what he would have said, if it had been possible for him to set his scattered thoughts in order., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the product of a mind similar to his own, but enormously more powerful, more systematic, less fear-ridden., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the best books, he perceived, are those that tell you what you know already., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had just turned back to chapter i when he heard julia's footstep on the stair and started out of his chair to meet her., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she dumped her brown tool-bag on the floor and flung herself into his arms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was more than a week since they had seen one another. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [i've got the book,' he said as they disentangled themselves. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [oh, you've got it?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [good, 'Orwell', '1984'], [,' she said without much interest, and almost immediately knelt down beside the oil stove to make the coffee., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they did not return to the subject until they had been in bed for half an hour., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the evening was just cool enough to make it worth while to pull up the counterpane., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from below came the familiar sound of singing and the scrape of boots on the flagstones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the brawny red-armed woman whom winston had seen there on his first visit was almost a fixture in the yard., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there seemed to be no hour of daylight when she was not marching to and fro between the washtub and the line, alternately gagging herself with clothes pegs and breaking forth into lusty song., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia had settled down on her side and seemed to be already on the point of falling asleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he reached out for the book, which was lying on the floor, and sat up against the bedhead. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [we must read it,' he said., 'Orwell', '1984'], ['you too., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all members of the brotherhood have to read it.', 'Orwell', '1984'], ['you read it,' she said with her eyes shut. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [read it aloud., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that's the best way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [then you can explain it to me as you go.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [the clock's hands said six, meaning eighteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they had three or four hours ahead of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he propped the book against his knees and began reading: chapter i ignorance is strength throughout recorded time, and probably since the end of the neolithic age, there have been three kinds of people in the world, the high, the middle, and the low., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they have been subdivided in many ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but the essential structure of society has never altered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even after enormous upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium, however far it is pushed one way or the other 'julia, are you awake?' said winston. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [yes, my love, i'm listening., 'Orwell', '1984'], [go on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it's marvellous.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [he continued reading: the aims of these three groups are entirely irreconcilable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the aim of the high is to remain where they are., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the aim of the middle is to change places with the high., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the aim of the low, when they have an aim--for it is an abiding characteristic of the low that they are too much crushed by drudgery to be more than intermittently conscious of anything outside their daily lives--is to abolish all distinctions and create a society in which all men shall be equal., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus throughout history a struggle which is the same in its main outlines recurs over and over again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for long periods the high seem to be securely in power, but sooner or later there always comes a moment when they lose either their belief in themselves or their capacity to govern efficiently, or both., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they are then overthrown by the middle, who enlist the low on their side by pretending to them that they are fighting for liberty and justice., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as soon as they have reached their objective, the middle thrust the low back into their old position of servitude, and themselves become the high., 'Orwell', '1984'], [presently a new middle group splits off from one of the other groups, or from both of them, and the struggle begins over again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [of the three groups, only the low are never even temporarily successful in achieving their aims., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would be an exaggeration to say that throughout history there has been no progress of a material kind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even today, in a period of decline, the average human being is physically better off than he was a few centuries ago., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but no advance in wealth, no softening of manners, no reform or revolution has ever brought human equality a millimetre nearer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the point of view of the low, no historic change has ever meant much more than a change in the name of their masters., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by the late nineteenth century the recurrence of this pattern had become obvious to many observers., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there then rose schools of thinkers who interpreted history as a cyclical process and claimed to show that inequality was the unalterable law of human life., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this doctrine, of course, had always had its adherents, but in the manner in which it was now put forward there was a significant change., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the past the need for a hierarchical form of society had been the doctrine specifically of the high., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had been preached by kings and aristocrats and by the priests, lawyers, and the like who were parasitical upon them, and it had generally been softened by promises of compensation in an imaginary world beyond the grave., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the middle, so long as it was struggling for power, had always made use of such terms as freedom, justice, and fraternity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [now, however, the concept of human brotherhood began to be assailed by people who were not yet in positions of command, but merely hoped to be so before long., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the past the middle had made revolutions under the banner of equality, and then had established a fresh tyranny as soon as the old one was overthrown., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the new middle groups in effect proclaimed their tyranny beforehand., 'Orwell', '1984'], [socialism, a theory which appeared in the early nineteenth century and was the last link in a chain of thought stretching back to the slave rebellions of antiquity, was still deeply infected by the utopianism of past ages., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in each variant of socialism that appeared from about 1900 onwards the aim of establishing liberty and equality was more and more openly abandoned., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the new movements which appeared in the middle years of the century, ingsoc in oceania, neo-bolshevism in eurasia, death-worship, as it is commonly called, in eastasia, had the conscious aim of perpetuating unfreedom and inequality., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these new movements, of course, grew out of the old ones and tended to keep their names and pay lip-service to their ideology., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the purpose of all of them was to arrest progress and freeze history at a chosen moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the familiar pendulum swing was to happen once more, and then stop., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as usual, the high were to be turned out by the middle, who would then become the high; but this time, by conscious strategy, the high would be able to maintain their position permanently., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the new doctrines arose partly because of the accumulation of historical knowledge, and the growth of the historical sense, which had hardly existed before the nineteenth century., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the cyclical movement of history was now intelligible, or appeared to be so; and if it was intelligible, then it was alterable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the principal, underlying cause was that, as early as the beginning of the twentieth century, human equality had become technically possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was still true that men were not equal in their native talents and that functions had to be specialized in ways that favoured some individuals against others; but there was no longer any real need for class distinctions or for large differences of wealth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in earlier ages, class distinctions had been not only inevitable but desirable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [inequality was the price of civilization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the development of machine production, however, the case was altered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even if it was still necessary for human beings to do different kinds of work, it was no longer necessary for them to live at different social or economic levels., 'Orwell', '1984'], [therefore, from the point of view of the new groups who were on the point of seizing power, human equality was no longer an ideal to be striven after, but a danger to be averted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in more primitive ages, when a just and peaceful society was in fact not possible, it had been fairly easy to believe it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the idea of an earthly paradise in which men should live together in a state of brotherhood, without laws and without brute labour, had haunted the human imagination for thousands of years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and this vision had had a certain hold even on the groups who actually profited by each historical change., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the heirs of the french, english, and american revolutions had partly believed in their own phrases about the rights of man, freedom of speech, equality before the law, and the like, and have even allowed their conduct to be influenced by them to some extent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but by the fourth decade of the twentieth century all the main currents of political thought were authoritarian., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the earthly paradise had been discredited at exactly the moment when it became realizable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [every new political theory, by whatever name it called itself, led back to hierarchy and regimentation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in the general hardening of outlook that set in round about 1930, practices which had been long abandoned, in some cases for hundreds of years--imprisonment without trial, the use of war prisoners as slaves, public executions, torture to extract confessions, the use of hostages, and the deportation of whole populations--not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlightened and progressive., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was only after a decade of national wars, civil wars, revolutions, and counter-revolutions in all parts of the world that ingsoc and its rivals emerged as fully worked-out political theories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but they had been foreshadowed by the various systems, generally called totalitarian, which had appeared earlier in the century, and the main outlines of the world which would emerge from the prevailing chaos had long been obvious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what kind of people would control this world had been equally obvious., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the new aristocracy was made up for the most part of bureaucrats, scientists, technicians, trade-union organizers, publicity experts, sociologists, teachers, journalists, and professional politicians., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these people, whose origins lay in the salaried middle class and the upper grades of the working class, had been shaped and brought together by the barren world of monopoly industry and centralized government., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as compared with their opposite numbers in past ages, they were less avaricious, less tempted by luxury, hungrier for pure power, and, above all, more conscious of what they were doing and more intent on crushing opposition., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this last difference was cardinal., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by comparison with that existing today, all the tyrannies of the past were half-hearted and inefficient., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ruling groups were always infected to some extent by liberal ideas, and were content to leave loose ends everywhere, to regard only the overt act and to be uninterested in what their subjects were thinking., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the catholic church of the middle ages was tolerant by modern standards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [part of the reason for this was that in the past no government had the power to keep its citizens under constant surveillance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the invention of print, however, made it easier to manipulate public opinion, and the film and the radio carried the process further., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with the development of television, and the technical advance which made it possible to receive and transmit simultaneously on the same instrument, private life came to an end., 'Orwell', '1984'], [every citizen, or at least every citizen important enough to be worth watching, could be kept for twenty-four hours a day under the eyes of the police and in the sound of official propaganda, with all other channels of communication closed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the possibility of enforcing not only complete obedience to the will of the state, but complete uniformity of opinion on all subjects, now existed for the first time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [after the revolutionary period of the fifties and sixties, society regrouped itself, as always, into high, middle, and low., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the new high group, unlike all its forerunners, did not act upon instinct but knew what was needed to safeguard its position., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had long been realized that the only secure basis for oligarchy is collectivism., 'Orwell', '1984'], [wealth and privilege are most easily defended when they are possessed jointly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the so-called 'abolition of private property' which took place in the middle years of the century meant, in effect, the concentration of property in far fewer hands than before: but with this difference, that the new owners were a group instead of a mass of individuals., 'Orwell', '1984'], [individually, no member of the party owns anything, except petty personal belongings., 'Orwell', '1984'], [collectively, the party owns everything in oceania, because it controls everything, and disposes of the products as it thinks fit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the years following the revolution it was able to step into this commanding position almost unopposed, because the whole process was represented as an act of collectivization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had always been assumed that if the capitalist class were expropriated, socialism must follow: and unquestionably the capitalists had been expropriated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [factories, mines, land, houses, transport--everything had been taken away from them: and since these things were no longer private property, it followed that they must be public property., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ingsoc, which grew out of the earlier socialist movement and inherited its phraseology, has in fact carried out the main item in the socialist programme; with the result, foreseen and intended beforehand, that economic inequality has been made permanent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the problems of perpetuating a hierarchical society go deeper than this., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there are only four ways in which a ruling group can fall from power., 'Orwell', '1984'], [either it is conquered from without, or it governs so inefficiently that the masses are stirred to revolt, or it allows a strong and discontented middle group to come into being, or it loses its own self-confidence and willingness to govern., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these causes do not operate singly, and as a rule all four of them are present in some degree., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a ruling class which could guard against all of them would remain in power permanently., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ultimately the determining factor is the mental attitude of the ruling class itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [after the middle of the present century, the first danger had in reality disappeared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [each of the three powers which now divide the world is in fact unconquerable, and could only become conquerable through slow demographic changes which a government with wide powers can easily avert., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the second danger, also, is only a theoretical one., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the recurrent economic crises of past times were totally unnecessary and are not now permitted to happen, but other and equally large dislocations can and do happen without having political results, because there is no way in which discontent can become articulate., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as for the problem of over-production, which has been latent in our society since the development of machine technique, it is solved by the device of continuous warfare (see chapter iii), which is also useful in keying up public morale to the necessary pitch., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the point of view of our present rulers, therefore, the only genuine dangers are the splitting-off of a new group of able, under-employed, power-hungry people, and the growth of liberalism and scepticism in their own ranks., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the problem, that is to say, is educational., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is a problem of continuously moulding the consciousness both of the directing group and of the larger executive group that lies immediately below it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the consciousness of the masses needs only to be influenced in a negative way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [given this background, one could infer, if one did not know it already, the general structure of oceanic society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at the apex of the pyramid comes big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother is infallible and all-powerful., 'Orwell', '1984'], [every success, every achievement, every victory, every scientific discovery, all knowledge, all wisdom, all happiness, all virtue, are held to issue directly from his leadership and inspiration., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nobody has ever seen big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he is a face on the hoardings, a voice on the telescreen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [we may be reasonably sure that he will never die, and there is already considerable uncertainty as to when he was born., 'Orwell', '1984'], [big brother is the guise in which the party chooses to exhibit itself to the world., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his function is to act as a focusing point for love, fear, and reverence, emotions which are more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization., 'Orwell', '1984'], [below big brother comes the inner party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its numbers limited to six millions, or something less than 2 per cent of the population of oceania., 'Orwell', '1984'], [below the inner party comes the outer party, which, if the inner party is described as the brain of the state, may be justly likened to the hands., 'Orwell', '1984'], [below that come the dumb masses whom we habitually refer to as 'the proles', numbering perhaps 85 per cent of the population., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the terms of our earlier classification, the proles are the low: for the slave population of the equatorial lands who pass constantly from conqueror to conqueror, are not a permanent or necessary part of the structure., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in principle, membership of these three groups is not hereditary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the child of inner party parents is in theory not born into the inner party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [admission to either branch of the party is by examination, taken at the age of sixteen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nor is there any racial discrimination, or any marked domination of one province by another., 'Orwell', '1984'], [jews, negroes, south americans of pure indian blood are to be found in the highest ranks of the party, and the administrators of any area are always drawn from the inhabitants of that area., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in no part of oceania do the inhabitants have the feeling that they are a colonial population ruled from a distant capital., 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceania has no capital, and its titular head is a person whose whereabouts nobody knows., 'Orwell', '1984'], [except that english is its chief lingua franca and newspeak its official language, it is not centralized in any way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its rulers are not held together by blood-ties but by adherence to a common doctrine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is true that our society is stratified, and very rigidly stratified, on what at first sight appear to be hereditary lines., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there is far less to-and-fro movement between the different groups than happened under capitalism or even in the pre-industrial age., 'Orwell', '1984'], [between the two branches of the party there is a certain amount of interchange, but only so much as will ensure that weaklings are excluded from the inner party and that ambitious members of the outer party are made harmless by allowing them to rise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [proletarians, in practice, are not allowed to graduate into the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the most gifted among them, who might possibly become nuclei of discontent, are simply marked down by the thought police and eliminated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this state of affairs is not necessarily permanent, nor is it a matter of principle., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party is not a class in the old sense of the word., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it does not aim at transmitting power to its own children, as such; and if there were no other way of keeping the ablest people at the top, it would be perfectly prepared to recruit an entire new generation from the ranks of the proletariat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the crucial years, the fact that the party was not a hereditary body did a great deal to neutralize opposition., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the older kind of socialist, who had been trained to fight against something called 'class privilege' assumed that what is not hereditary cannot be permanent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not see that the continuity of an oligarchy need not be physical, nor did he pause to reflect that hereditary aristocracies have always been shortlived, whereas adoptive organizations such as the catholic church have sometimes lasted for hundreds or thousands of years., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the essence of oligarchical rule is not father-to-son inheritance, but the persistence of a certain world-view and a certain way of life, imposed by the dead upon the living., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a ruling group is a ruling group so long as it can nominate its successors., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party is not concerned with perpetuating its blood but with perpetuating itself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [who wields power is not important, provided that the hierarchical structure remains always the same., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all the beliefs, habits, tastes, emotions, mental attitudes that characterize our time are really designed to sustain the mystique of the party and prevent the true nature of present-day society from being perceived., 'Orwell', '1984'], [physical rebellion, or any preliminary move towards rebellion, is at present not possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the proletarians nothing is to be feared., 'Orwell', '1984'], [left to themselves, they will continue from generation to generation and from century to century, working, breeding, and dying, not only without any impulse to rebel, but without the power of grasping that the world could be other than it is., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they could only become dangerous if the advance of industrial technique made it necessary to educate them more highly; but, since military and commercial rivalry are no longer important, the level of popular education is actually declining., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what opinions the masses hold, or do not hold, is looked on as a matter of indifference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in a party member, on the other hand, not even the smallest deviation of opinion on the most unimportant subject can be tolerated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a party member lives from birth to death under the eye of the thought police., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even when he is alone he can never be sure that he is alone., 'Orwell', '1984'], [wherever he may be, asleep or awake, working or resting, in his bath or in bed, he can be inspected without warning and without knowing that he is being inspected., 'Orwell', '1984'], [nothing that he does is indifferent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his friendships, his relaxations, his behaviour towards his wife and children, the expression of his face when he is alone, the words he mutters in sleep, even the characteristic movements of his body, are all jealously scrutinized., 'Orwell', '1984'], [not only any actual misdemeanour, but any eccentricity, however small, any change of habits, any nervous mannerism that could possibly be the symptom of an inner struggle, is certain to be detected., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he has no freedom of choice in any direction whatever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the other hand his actions are not regulated by law or by any clearly formulated code of behaviour., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in oceania there is no law., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thoughts and actions which, when detected, mean certain death are not formally forbidden, and the endless purges, arrests, tortures, imprisonments, and vaporizations are not inflicted as punishment for crimes which have actually been committed, but are merely the wiping-out of persons who might perhaps commit a crime at some time in the future., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a party member is required to have not only the right opinions, but the right instincts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [many of the beliefs and attitudes demanded of him are never plainly stated, and could not be stated without laying bare the contradictions inherent in ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if he is a person naturally orthodox (in newspeak a goodthinker), he will in all circumstances know, without taking thought, what is the true belief or the desirable emotion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in any case an elaborate mental training, undergone in childhood and grouping itself round the newspeak words crimestop, blackwhite, and doublethink, makes him unwilling and unable to think too deeply on any subject, 'Orwell', '1984'], [whatever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a party member is expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he is supposed to live in a continuous frenzy of hatred of foreign enemies and internal traitors, triumph over victories, and self-abasement before the power and wisdom of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the discontents produced by his bare, unsatisfying life are deliberately turned outwards and dissipated by such devices as the two minutes hate, and the speculations which might possibly induce a sceptical or rebellious attitude are killed in advance by his early acquired inner discipline., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the first and simplest stage in the discipline, which can be taught even to young children, is called, in newspeak, crimestop., 'Orwell', '1984'], [crimestop means the faculty of stopping short, as though by instinct, at the threshold of any dangerous thought., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it includes the power of not grasping analogies, of failing to perceive logical errors, of misunderstanding the simplest arguments if they are inimical to ingsoc, and of being bored or repelled by any train of thought which is capable of leading in a heretical direction., 'Orwell', '1984'], [crimestop, in short, means protective stupidity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but stupidity is not enough., 'Orwell', '1984'], [on the contrary, orthodoxy in the full sense demands a control over one's own mental processes as complete as that of a contortionist over his body., 'Orwell', '1984'], [oceanic society rests ultimately on the belief that big brother is omnipotent and that the party is infallible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but since in reality big brother is not omnipotent and the party is not infallible, there is need for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the keyword here is blackwhite., 'Orwell', '1984'], [like so many newspeak words, this word has two mutually contradictory meanings., 'Orwell', '1984'], [applied to an opponent, it means the habit of impudently claiming that black is white, in contradiction of the plain facts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [applied to a party member, it means a loyal willingness to say that black is white when party discipline demands this., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it means also the ability to believe that black is white, and more, to know that black is white, and to forget that one has ever believed the contrary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this demands a continuous alteration of the past, made possible by the system of thought which really embraces all the rest, and which is known in newspeak as doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the alteration of the past is necessary for two reasons, one of which is subsidiary and, so to speak, precautionary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the subsidiary reason is that the party member, like the proletarian, tolerates present-day conditions partly because he has no standards of comparison., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he must be cut off from the past, just as he must be cut off from foreign countries, because it is necessary for him to believe that he is better off than his ancestors and that the average level of material comfort is constantly rising., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but by far the more important reason for the readjustment of the past is the need to safeguard the infallibility of the party., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the party were in all cases right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is also that no change in doctrine or in political alignment can ever be admitted., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for to change one's mind, or even one's policy, is a confession of weakness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if, for example, eurasia or eastasia (whichever it may be) is the enemy today, then that country must always have been the enemy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and if the facts say otherwise then the facts must be altered., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus history is continuously rewritten., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this day-to-day falsification of the past, carried out by the ministry of truth, is as necessary to the stability of the regime as the work of repression and espionage carried out by the ministry of love., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the mutability of the past is the central tenet of ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [past events, it is argued, have no objective existence, but survive only in written records and in human memories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the past is whatever the records and the memories agree upon., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and since the party is in full control of all records and in equally full control of the minds of its members, it follows that the past is whatever the party chooses to make it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it also follows that though the past is alterable, it never has been altered in any specific instance., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for when it has been recreated in whatever shape is needed at the moment, then this new version is the past, and no different past can ever have existed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this holds good even when, as often happens, the same event has to be altered out of recognition several times in the course of a year., 'Orwell', '1984'], [at all times the party is in possession of absolute truth, and clearly the absolute can never have been different from what it is now., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it will be seen that the control of the past depends above all on the training of memory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to make sure that all written records agree with the orthodoxy of the moment is merely a mechanical act., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it is also necessary to remember that events happened in the desired manner., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and if it is necessary to rearrange one's memories or to tamper with written records, then it is necessary to forget that one has done so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the trick of doing this can be learned like any other mental technique., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is learned by the majority of party members, and certainly by all who are intelligent as well as orthodox., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in oldspeak it is called, quite frankly, 'reality control'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in newspeak it is called doublethink, though doublethink comprises much else as well., 'Orwell', '1984'], [doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the party intellectual knows in which direction his memories must be altered; he therefore knows that he is playing tricks with reality; but by the exercise of doublethink he also satisfies himself that reality is not violated., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the process has to be conscious, or it would not be carried out with sufficient precision, but it also has to be unconscious, or it would bring with it a feeling of falsity and hence of guilt., 'Orwell', '1984'], [doublethink lies at the very heart of ingsoc, since the essential act of the party is to use conscious deception while retaining the firmness of purpose that goes with complete honesty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to tell deliberate lies while genuinely believing in them, to forget any fact that has become inconvenient, and then, when it becomes necessary again, to draw it back from oblivion for just so long as it is needed, to deny the existence of objective reality and all the while to take account of the reality which one denies--all this is indispensably necessary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even in using the word doublethink it is necessary to exercise doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for by using the word one admits that one is tampering with reality; by a fresh act of doublethink one erases this knowledge; and so on indefinitely, with the lie always one leap ahead of the truth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ultimately it is by means of doublethink that the party has been able--and may, for all we know, continue to be able for thousands of years--to arrest the course of history., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all past oligarchies have fallen from power either because they ossified or because they grew soft., 'Orwell', '1984'], [either they became stupid and arrogant, failed to adjust themselves to changing circumstances, and were overthrown; or they became liberal and cowardly, made concessions when they should have used force, and once again were overthrown., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they fell, that is to say, either through consciousness or through unconsciousness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is the achievement of the party to have produced a system of thought in which both conditions can exist simultaneously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and upon no other intellectual basis could the dominion of the party be made permanent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if one is to rule, and to continue ruling, one must be able to dislocate the sense of reality., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the secret of rulership is to combine a belief in one's own infallibility with the power to learn from past mistakes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it need hardly be said that the subtlest practitioners of doublethink are those who invented doublethink and know that it is a vast system of mental cheating., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in our society, those who have the best knowledge of what is happening are also those who are furthest from seeing the world as it is., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in general, the greater the understanding, the greater the delusion; the more intelligent, the less sane., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one clear illustration of this is the fact that war hysteria increases in intensity as one rises in the social scale., 'Orwell', '1984'], [those whose attitude towards the war is most nearly rational are the subject peoples of the disputed territories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to these people the war is simply a continuous calamity which sweeps to and fro over their bodies like a tidal wave., 'Orwell', '1984'], [which side is winning is a matter of complete indifference to them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they are aware that a change of overlordship means simply that they will be doing the same work as before for new masters who treat them in the same manner as the old ones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the slightly more favoured workers whom we call 'the proles' are only intermittently conscious of the war., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when it is necessary they can be prodded into frenzies of fear and hatred, but when left to themselves they are capable of forgetting for long periods that the war is happening., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is in the ranks of the party, and above all of the inner party, that the true war enthusiasm is found., 'Orwell', '1984'], [world-conquest is believed in most firmly by those who know it to be impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this peculiar linking-together of opposites--knowledge with ignorance, cynicism with fanaticism--is one of the chief distinguishing marks of oceanic society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the official ideology abounds with contradictions even when there is no practical reason for them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus, the party rejects and vilifies every principle for which the socialist movement originally stood, and it chooses to do this in the name of socialism., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it preaches a contempt for the working class unexampled for centuries past, and it dresses its members in a uniform which was at one time peculiar to manual workers and was adopted for that reason., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it systematically undermines the solidarity of the family, and it calls its leader by a name which is a direct appeal to the sentiment of family loyalty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the names of the four ministries by which we are governed exhibit a sort of impudence in their deliberate reversal of the facts., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the ministry of peace concerns itself with war, the ministry of truth with lies, the ministry of love with torture and the ministry of plenty with starvation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy; they are deliberate exercises in doublethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for it is only by reconciling contradictions that power can be retained indefinitely., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in no other way could the ancient cycle be broken., 'Orwell', '1984'], [if human equality is to be for ever averted--if the high, as we have called them, are to keep their places permanently--then the prevailing mental condition must be controlled insanity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but there is one question which until this moment we have almost ignored., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is; why should human equality be averted?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [supposing that the mechanics of the process have been rightly described, what is the motive for this huge, accurately planned effort to freeze history at a particular moment of time?, 'Orwell', '1984'], [here we reach the central secret., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as we have seen., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the mystique of the party, and above all of the inner party, depends upon doublethink but deeper than this lies the original motive, the never-questioned instinct that first led to the seizure of power and brought doublethink, the thought police, continuous warfare, and all the other necessary paraphernalia into existence afterwards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this motive really consists..., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston became aware of silence, as one becomes aware of a new sound., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it seemed to him that julia had been very still for some time past., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was lying on her side, naked from the waist upwards, with her cheek pillowed on her hand and one dark lock tumbling across her eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [her breast rose and fell slowly and regularly. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [no answer. ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia, are you awake?', 'Orwell', '1984'], [no answer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [she was asleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he shut the book, put it carefully on the floor, lay down, and pulled the coverlet over both of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had still, he reflected, not learned the ultimate secret., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he understood how; he did not understand why., 'Orwell', '1984'], [chapter i, like chapter iii, had not actually told him anything that he did not know, it had merely systematized the knowledge that he possessed already., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but after reading it he knew better than before that he was not mad., 'Orwell', '1984'], [being in a minority, even a minority of one, did not make you mad., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a yellow beam from the sinking sun slanted in through the window and fell across the pillow., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he shut his eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the sun on his face and the girl's smooth body touching his own gave him a strong, sleepy, confident feeling., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was safe, everything was all right., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he fell asleep murmuring 'sanity is not statistical,' with the feeling that this remark contained in it a profound wisdom., 'Orwell', '1984'], [*, 'Orwell', '1984'], [*, 'Orwell', '1984'], [*, 'Orwell', '1984'], [** when he woke it was with the sensation of having slept for a long time, but a glance at the old-fashioned clock told him that it was only twenty-thirty., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he lay dozing for a while; then the usual deep-lunged singing struck up from the yard below: 'it was only an 'opeless fancy, it passed like an ipril dye, but a look an' a word an' the dreams they stirred they ', 'Orwell', '1984'], [ave stolen my 'eart awye!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [the drivelling song seemed to have kept its popularity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [you still heard it all over the place., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it had outlived the hate song., 'Orwell', '1984'], [julia woke at the sound, stretched herself luxuriously, and got out of bed.

not seen darkness or daylight., 'Orwell', '1984'], [besides, his memories were not continuous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [with that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started., 'Orwell', '1984'], [later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was a long range of crimes--espionage, sabotage, and the like--to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the confession was a formality, though the torture was real., 'Orwell', '1984'], [how many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember., 'Orwell', '1984'], [always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: 'i will confess, but not yet., 'Orwell', '1984'], [i must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [three more kicks, two more kicks, and, 'Orwell', '1984'], [then i will tell them what they want.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were also longer periods of recovery., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted--he thought, he could not be sure--ten or twelve hours at a stretch., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session., 'Orwell', '1984'], [most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of ingsoc and big brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he confessed to the assassination of eminent party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the eastasian government as far back as 1968., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody., 'Orwell', '1984'], [besides, in a sense it was all true., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was true that he had been the enemy of the party, and in the eyes of the party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were also memories of another kind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they stood out in his mind disconnectedly, like pictures with blackness all round them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was in a cell which might have been either dark or light, because he could see nothing except a pair of eyes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [near at hand some kind of instrument was ticking slowly and regularly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the eyes grew larger and more luminous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [suddenly he floated out of his seat, dived into the eyes, and was swallowed up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was strapped into a chair surrounded by dials,

wall, while the younger child wailed intermittently., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the end his mother said, 'now be good, and i'll buy you a toy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a lovely toy--you'll love it';, 'Orwell', '1984'], [and then she had gone out in the rain, to a little general shop which was still sporadically open nearby, and came back with a cardboard box containing an outfit of snakes and ladders., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could still remember the smell of the damp cardboard., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a miserable outfit., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the board was cracked and the tiny wooden dice were so ill-cut that they would hardly lie on their sides., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston looked at the thing sulkily and without interest., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but then his mother lit a piece of candle and they sat down on the floor to play., 'Orwell', '1984'], [soon he was wildly excited and shouting with laughter as the tiddly-winks climbed hopefully up the ladders and then came slithering down the snakes again, almost to the starting-point., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they played eight games, winning four each., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his tiny sister, too young to understand what the game was about, had sat propped up against a bolster, laughing because the others were laughing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for a whole afternoon they had all been happy together, as in his earlier childhood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he pushed the picture out of his mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was a false memory., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was troubled by false memories occasionally., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they did not matter so long as one knew them for what they were., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some things had happened, others had not happened., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he turned back to the chessboard and picked up the white knight again., 'Orwell', '1984'], [almost in the same instant it dropped on to the board with a clatter., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had started as though a pin had run into him., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a shrill trumpet-call had pierced the air., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was the bulletin!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [victory!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [it always meant victory when a trumpet-call preceded the news., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a sort of electric drill ran through the cafe., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even the waiters had started and pricked up their ears., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the trumpet-call had let loose an enormous volume of noise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the news had run round the streets like magic., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black., 'Orwell', '1984'], [fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: 'vast strategic manoeuvre--perfect co-ordination--utter rout--half a million prisoners--complete demoralization--control of the whole of africa--bring the war within measurable distance of its end--victory--greatest victory in human history--victory, victory, victory!', 'Orwell', '1984'], [under the table winston's feet made convulsive movements., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he looked up again at the portrait of big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the colossus that bestrode the world!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [the rock against which the hordes of asia dashed themselves in vain!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [he thought how ten minutes ago--yes, only ten minutes--there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ah, it was more than a eurasian army that had perished!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [much had changed in him since that first day in the ministry of love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the waiters were turning back to their work., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one of them approached with the gin bottle., 'Orwell', '1984'], [winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was not running or cheering any longer., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was back in the ministry of love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the long-hoped-for bullet was entering his brain., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he gazed up at the enormous face., 'Orwell', '1984'], [forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache., 'Orwell', '1984'], [o cruel, needless misunderstanding!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [o stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast!, 'Orwell', '1984'], [two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he had won the victory over himself., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he loved big brother., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the end appendix., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the principles of newspeak newspeak was the official language of oceania and had been devised to meet the ideological needs of ingsoc, or english socialism., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the year 1984 there was not as yet anyone who used newspeak as his sole means of communication, either in speech or writing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the leading articles in 'the times' were written in it, but this was a tour de force which could only be carried out by a specialist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was expected that newspeak would have finally superseded oldspeak (or standard english, as we should call it) by about the year 2050., 'Orwell', '1984'], [meanwhile it gained ground steadily, all party members tending to use newspeak words and grammatical constructions more and more in their everyday speech., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the version in use in 1984, and embodied in the ninth and tenth editions of the newspeak dictionary, was a provisional one, and contained many superfluous words and archaic formations which were due to be suppressed later., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it is with the final, perfected version, as embodied in the eleventh edition of the dictionary, that we are concerned here., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the purpose of newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was intended that when newspeak had been adopted once and for all and oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought--that is, a thought diverging from the principles of ingsoc--should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was done partly by the invention of new words, but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words and by stripping such words as remained of unorthodox meanings, and so far as possible of all secondary meanings whatever. to give a single example., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the word free still existed in newspeak, but it could only be used in such statements as 'this dog is free from lice' or 'this field is free from weeds'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it could not be used in its old sense of 'politically free' or 'intellectually free' since political and intellectual freedom no longer existed even as concepts, and were therefore of necessity nameless., 'Orwell', '1984'], [quite apart from the suppression of definitely heretical words, reduction of vocabulary was regarded as an end in itself, and no word that could be dispensed with was allowed to survive., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought, and this purpose was indirectly assisted by cutting the choice of words down to a minimum., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspeak was founded on the english language as we now know it, though many newspeak sentences, even when not containing newly-created words, would be barely intelligible to an english-speaker of our own day., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspeak words were divided into three distinct classes, known as the a vocabulary, the b vocabulary (also called compound words), and the c vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it will be simpler to discuss each class separately, but the grammatical peculiarities of the language can be dealt with in the section devoted to the a vocabulary, since the same rules held good for all three categories., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the a vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the a vocabulary consisted of the words needed for the business of everyday life--for such things as eating, drinking, working, putting on one's clothes, going up and down stairs, riding in vehicles, gardening, cooking, and the like., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was composed almost entirely of words that we already possess words like hit, run, dog, tree, sugar, house, field--but in comparison with the present-day english vocabulary their number was extremely small, while their meanings were far more rigidly defined., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all ambiguities and shades of meaning had been purged out of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so far as it could be achieved, a newspeak word of this class was simply a staccato sound expressing one clearly understood concept., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would have been quite impossible to use the a vocabulary for literary purposes or for political or philosophical discussion., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was intended only to express simple, purposive thoughts, usually involving concrete objects or physical actions., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the grammar of newspeak had two outstanding peculiarities., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the first of these was an almost complete interchangeability between different parts of speech., 'Orwell', '1984'], [any word in the language (in principle this applied even to very abstract words such as if or when) could be used either as verb, noun, adjective, or adverb., 'Orwell', '1984'], [between the verb and the noun form, when they were of the same root, there was never any variation, this rule of itself involving the destruction of many archaic forms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the word thought, for example, did not exist in newspeak., 'Orwell', '1984'], [its place was taken by think, which did duty for both noun and verb., 'Orwell', '1984'], [no etymological principle was followed here: in some cases it was the original noun that was chosen for retention, in other cases the verb., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even where a noun and verb of kindred meaning were not etymologically connected, one or other of them was frequently suppressed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was, for example, no such word as cut, its meaning being sufficiently covered by the noun-verb knife., 'Orwell', '1984'], [adjectives were formed by adding the suffix -ful to the noun-verb, and adverbs by adding -wise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus for example, speedful meant 'rapid' and speedwise meant 'quickly'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [certain of our present-day adjectives, such as good, strong, big, black, soft, were retained, but their total number was very small., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was little need for them, since almost any adjectival meaning could be arrived at by adding -ful to a noun-verb., 'Orwell', '1984'], [none of the now-existing adverbs was retained, except for a very few already ending in -wise: the -wise termination was invariable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the word well, for example, was replaced by goodwise., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in addition, any word--this again applied in principle to every word in the language--could be negatived by adding the affix un-, or could be strengthened by the affix plus-, or, for still greater emphasis, doubleplus-., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus, for example, uncold meant 'warm', while pluscold and doublepluscold meant, respectively, 'very cold' and 'superlatively cold'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was also possible, as in present-day english, to modify the meaning of almost any word by prepositional affixes such as ante-, post-, up-, down-, etc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [by such methods it was found possible to bring about an enormous diminution of vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [given, for instance, the word good, there was no need for such a word as bad, since the required meaning was equally well--indeed, better--expressed by ungood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all that was necessary, in any case where two words formed a natural pair of opposites, was to decide which of them to suppress., 'Orwell', '1984'], [dark, for example, could be replaced by unlight, or light by undark, according to preference., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the second distinguishing mark of newspeak grammar was its regularity., 'Orwell', '1984'], [subject to a few exceptions which are mentioned below all inflexions followed the same rules., 'Orwell', '1984'], [thus, in all verbs the preterite and the past participle were the same and ended in -ed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the preterite of steal was stealed, the preterite of think was thinked, and so on throughout the language, all such forms as swam, gave, brought, spoke, taken, etc., being abolished., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all plurals were made by adding -s or -es as the case might be., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the plurals of man, ox, life, were mans, oxes, lifes., 'Orwell', '1984'], [comparison of adjectives was invariably made by adding -er, -est (good, gooder, goodest), irregular forms and the more, most formation being suppressed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the only classes of words that were still allowed to inflect irregularly were the pronouns, the relatives, the demonstrative adjectives, and the auxiliary verbs., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all of these followed their ancient usage, except that whom had been scrapped as unnecessary, and the shall, should tenses had been dropped, all their uses being covered by will and would., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were also certain irregularities in word-formation arising out of the need for rapid and easy speech., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a word which was difficult to utter, or was liable to be incorrectly heard, was held to be ipso facto a bad word; occasionally therefore, for the sake of euphony, extra letters were inserted into a word or an archaic formation was retained., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this need made itself felt chiefly in connexion with the b vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [why so great an importance was attached to ease of pronunciation will be made clear later in this essay., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the b vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the b vocabulary consisted of words which had been deliberately constructed for political purposes:, 'Orwell', '1984'], [words, that is to say, which not only had in every case a political implication, but were intended to impose a desirable mental attitude upon the person using them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [without a full understanding of the principles of ingsoc it was difficult to use these words correctly., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in some cases they could be translated into oldspeak, or even into words taken from the a vocabulary, but this usually demanded a long paraphrase and always involved the loss of certain overtones., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the b words were a sort of verbal shorthand, often packing whole ranges of ideas into a few syllables, and at the same time more accurate and forcible than ordinary language., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the b words were in all cases compound words., 'Orwell', '1984'], [[compound words such as speakwrite, were of course to be found in the a vocabulary, but these were merely convenient abbreviations and had no special ideological colour.], 'Orwell', '1984'], [they consisted of two or more words, or portions of words, welded together in an easily pronounceable form., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the resulting amalgam was always a noun-verb, and inflected according to the ordinary rules., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to take a single example: the word goodthink, meaning, very roughly, 'orthodoxy', or, if one chose to regard it as a verb, 'to think in an orthodox manner'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this inflected as follows: noun-verb, goodthink; past tense and past participle, goodthinked; present participle, good-thinking; adjective, goodthinkful; adverb, goodthinkwise; verbal noun, goodthinker., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the b words were not constructed on any etymological plan., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the words of which they were made up could be any parts of speech, and could be placed in any order and mutilated in any way which made them easy to pronounce while indicating their derivation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the word crimethink (thoughtcrime), for instance, the think came second, whereas in thinkpol (thought police) it came first, and in the latter word police had lost its second syllable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [because of the great difficulty in securing euphony, irregular formations were commoner in the b vocabulary than in the a vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for example, the adjective forms of minitrue, minipax, and miniluv were, respectively, minitruthful, minipeaceful, and minilovely, simply because -trueful, -paxful, and -loveful were slightly awkward to pronounce., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in principle, however, all b words could inflect, and all inflected in exactly the same way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some of the b words had highly subtilized meanings, barely intelligible to anyone who had not mastered the language as a whole., 'Orwell', '1984'], [consider, for example, such a typical sentence from a 'times' leading article as oldthinkers unbellyfeel ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the shortest rendering that one could make of this in oldspeak would be: 'those whose ideas were formed before the revolution cannot have a full emotional understanding of the principles of english socialism.', 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this is not an adequate translation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [to begin with, in order to grasp the full meaning of the newspeak sentence quoted above, one would have to have a clear idea of what is meant by ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and in addition, only a person thoroughly grounded in ingsoc could appreciate the full force of the word bellyfeel, which implied a blind, enthusiastic acceptance difficult to imagine today; or of the word oldthink, which was inextricably mixed up with the idea of wickedness and decadence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but the special function of certain newspeak words, of which oldthink was one, was not so much to express meanings as to destroy them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these words, necessarily few in number, had had their meanings extended until they contained within themselves whole batteries of words which, as they were sufficiently covered by a single comprehensive term, could now be scrapped and forgotten., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the greatest difficulty facing the compilers of the newspeak dictionary was not to invent new words, but, having invented them, to make sure what they meant: to make sure, that is to say, what ranges of words they cancelled by their existence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [as we have already seen in the case of the word free, words which had once borne a heretical meaning were sometimes retained for the sake of convenience, but only with the undesirable meanings purged out of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [countless other words such as honour, justice, morality, internationalism, democracy, science, and religion had simply ceased to exist., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a few blanket words covered them, and, in covering them, abolished them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [all words grouping themselves round the concepts of liberty and equality, for instance, were contained in the single word crimethink, while all words grouping themselves round the concepts of objectivity and rationalism were contained in the single word oldthink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [greater precision would have been dangerous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [what was required in a party member was an outlook similar to that of the ancient hebrew who knew, without knowing much else, that all nations other than his own worshipped 'false gods'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he did not need to know that these gods were called baal, osiris, moloch, ashtaroth, and the like: probably the less he knew about them the better for his orthodoxy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew jehovah and the commandments of jehovah: he knew, therefore, that all gods with other names or other attributes were false gods., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in somewhat the same way, the party member knew what constituted right conduct, and in exceedingly vague, generalized terms he knew what kinds of departure from it were possible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his sexual life, for example, was entirely regulated by the two newspeak words sexcrime (sexual immorality) and goodsex (chastity)., 'Orwell', '1984'], [sexcrime covered all sexual misdeeds, 'Orwell', '1984'], [whatever., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it covered fornication, adultery, homosexuality, and other perversions, and, in addition, normal intercourse practised for its own sake., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was no need to enumerate them separately, since they were all equally culpable, and, in principle, all punishable by death., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the c vocabulary, which consisted of scientific and technical words, it might be necessary to give specialized names to certain sexual aberrations, but the ordinary citizen had no need of them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [he knew what was meant by goodsex--that is to say, normal intercourse between man and wife, for the sole purpose of begetting children, and without physical pleasure on the part of the woman: all else was sexcrime., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in newspeak it was seldom possible to follow a heretical thought further than the perception that it was heretical: beyond that point the necessary words were nonexistent., 'Orwell', '1984'], [no word in the b vocabulary was ideologically neutral., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a great many were euphemisms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [such words, for instance, as joycamp (forced-labour camp) or minipax (ministry of peace, i.e. ministry of war) meant almost the exact opposite of what they appeared to mean., 'Orwell', '1984'], [some words, on the other hand, displayed a frank and contemptuous understanding of the real nature of oceanic society., 'Orwell', '1984'], [an example was prolefeed, meaning the rubbishy entertainment and spurious news which the party handed out to the masses., 'Orwell', '1984'], [other words, again, were ambivalent, having the connotation 'good' when applied to the party and 'bad' when applied to its enemies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but in addition there were great numbers of words which at first sight appeared to be mere abbreviations and which derived their ideological colour not from their meaning, but from their structure., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number of syllables that would preserve the original derivation., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the ministry of truth, for example, the records department, in which winston smith worked, was called recdep, the fiction department was called ficdep, the teleprogrammes department was called teledep, and so on., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this was not done solely with the object of saving time., 'Orwell', '1984'], [even in the early decades of the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations., 'Orwell', '1984'], [examples were such words as nazi, gestapo, comintern, inprecorr, agitprop. in the beginning the practice had been adopted as it were instinctively, but in newspeak it was used with a conscious purpose., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was perceived that in thus abbreviating a name one narrowed and subtly altered its meaning, by cutting out most of the associations that would otherwise cling to it., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the words communist international, for instance, call up a composite picture of universal human brotherhood, red flags, barricades, karl marx, and the paris commune., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the word comintern, on the other hand, suggests merely a tightly-knit organization and a well-defined body of doctrine., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it refers to something almost as easily recognized, and as limited in purpose, as a chair or a table., 'Orwell', '1984'], [comintern is a word that can be uttered almost without taking thought, whereas communist international is a phrase over which one is obliged to linger at least momentarily., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the same way, the associations called up by a word like minitrue are fewer and more controllable than those called up by ministry of truth., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this accounted not only for the habit of abbreviating whenever possible, but also for the almost exaggerated care that was taken to make every word easily pronounceable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in newspeak, euphony outweighed every consideration other than exactitude of meaning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [regularity of grammar was always sacrificed to it when it seemed necessary. and rightly so, since what was required, above all for political purposes, was short clipped words of unmistakable meaning which could be uttered rapidly and which roused the minimum of echoes in the speaker's mind., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the words of the b vocabulary even gained in force from the fact that nearly all of them were very much alike., 'Orwell', '1984'], [almost invariably these words--goodthink, minipax, prolefeed, sexcrime, joycamp, ingsoc, bellyfeel, thinkpol, and countless others--were words of two or three syllables, with the stress distributed equally between the first syllable and the last., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the use of them encouraged a gabbling style of speech, at once staccato and monotonous., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and this was exactly what was aimed at., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the intention was to make speech, and especially speech on any subject not ideologically neutral, as nearly as possible independent of consciousness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for the purposes of everyday life it was no doubt necessary, or sometimes necessary, to reflect before speaking, but a party member called upon to make a political or ethical judgement should be able to spray forth the correct opinions as automatically as a machine gun spraying forth bullets., 'Orwell', '1984'], [his training fitted him to do this, the language gave him an almost foolproof instrument, and the texture of the words, with their harsh sound and a certain wilful ugliness which was in accord with the spirit of ingsoc, assisted the process still further., 'Orwell', '1984'], [so did the fact of having very few words to choose from., 'Orwell', '1984'], [relative to our own, the newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised., 'Orwell', '1984'], [newspeak, indeed, differed from most all other languages in that its vocabulary grew smaller instead of larger every year., 'Orwell', '1984'], [each reduction was a gain, since the smaller the area of choice, the smaller the temptation to take thought., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ultimately it was hoped to make articulate speech issue from the larynx without involving the higher brain centres at all., 'Orwell', '1984'], [this aim was frankly admitted in the newspeak word duckspeak, meaning 'to quack like a duck'., 'Orwell', '1984'], [like various other words in the b vocabulary, duckspeak was ambivalent in meaning., 'Orwell', '1984'], [provided that the opinions which were quacked out were orthodox ones, it implied nothing but praise, and when 'the times' referred to one of the orators of the party as a doubleplusgood duckspeaker it was paying a warm and valued compliment., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the c vocabulary., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the c vocabulary was supplementary to the others and consisted entirely of scientific and technical terms., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these resembled the scientific terms in use today, and were constructed from the same roots, but the usual care was taken to define them rigidly and strip them of undesirable meanings., 'Orwell', '1984'], [they followed the same grammatical rules as the words in the other two vocabularies., 'Orwell', '1984'], [very few of the c words had any currency either in everyday speech or in political speech., 'Orwell', '1984'], [any scientific worker or technician could find all the words he needed in the list devoted to his own speciality, but he seldom had more than a smattering of the words occurring in the other lists., 'Orwell', '1984'], [only a very few words were common to all lists, and there was no vocabulary expressing the function of science as a habit of mind, or a method of thought, irrespective of its particular branches., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there was, indeed, no word for 'science', any meaning that it could possibly bear being already sufficiently covered by the word ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [from the foregoing account it will be seen that in newspeak the expression of unorthodox opinions, above a very low level, was well-nigh impossible., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was of course possible to utter heresies of a very crude kind, a species of blasphemy., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it would have been possible, for example, to say big brother is ungood., 'Orwell', '1984'], [but this statement, which to an orthodox ear merely conveyed a self-evident absurdity, could not have been sustained by reasoned argument, because the necessary words were not available., 'Orwell', '1984'], [ideas inimical to ingsoc could only be entertained in a vague wordless form, and could only be named in very broad terms which lumped together and condemned whole groups of heresies without defining them in doing so., 'Orwell', '1984'], [one could, in fact, only use newspeak for unorthodox purposes by illegitimately translating some of the words back into oldspeak., 'Orwell', '1984'], [for example, all mans are equal was a possible newspeak sentence, but only in the same sense in which all men are redhaired is a possible oldspeak sentence., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it did not contain a grammatical error, but it expressed a palpable untruth--i.e., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that all men are of equal size, weight, or strength., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the concept of political equality no longer existed, and this secondary meaning had accordingly been purged out of the word equal., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in 1984, when oldspeak was still the normal means of communication, the danger theoretically existed that in using newspeak words one might remember their original meanings., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in practice it was not difficult for any person well grounded in doublethink to avoid doing this, but within a couple of generations even the possibility of such a lapse would have vanished., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a person growing up with newspeak as his sole language would no more know that equal had once had the secondary meaning of 'politically equal', or that free had once meant 'intellectually free', than for instance, a person who had never heard of chess would be aware of the secondary meanings attaching to queen and rook., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there would be many crimes and errors which it would be beyond his power to commit, simply because they were nameless and therefore unimaginable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [and it was to be foreseen that with the passage of time the distinguishing characteristics of newspeak would become more and more pronounced--its words growing fewer and fewer, their meanings more and more rigid, and the chance of putting them to improper uses always diminishing., 'Orwell', '1984'], [when oldspeak had been once and for all superseded, the last link with the past would have been severed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [history had already been rewritten, but fragments of the literature of the past survived here and there, imperfectly censored, and so long as one retained one's knowledge of oldspeak it was possible to read them., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in the future such fragments, even if they chanced to survive, would be unintelligible and untranslatable., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was impossible to translate any passage of oldspeak into newspeak unless it either referred to some technical process or some very simple everyday action, or was already orthodox (goodthinkful would be the newspeak expression) in tendency., 'Orwell', '1984'], [in practice this meant that no book written before approximately 1960 could be translated as a whole. pre-revolutionary literature could only be subjected to ideological translation--that is, alteration in sense as well as language., 'Orwell', '1984'], [take for example the well-known passage from the declaration of independence, 'Orwell', '1984'], [: we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their powers from the consent of the governed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government... it would have been quite impossible to render this into newspeak while keeping to the sense of the original., 'Orwell', '1984'], [the nearest one could come to doing so would be to swallow the whole passage up in the single word crimethink., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a full translation could only be an ideological translation, whereby jefferson's words would be changed into a panegyric on absolute government., 'Orwell', '1984'], [a good deal of the literature of the past was, indeed, already being transformed in this way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [considerations of prestige made it desirable to preserve the memory of certain historical figures, while at the same time bringing their achievements into line with the philosophy of ingsoc., 'Orwell', '1984'], [various writers, such as shakespeare, milton, swift, byron, dickens, and some others were therefore in process of translation: when the task had been completed, their original writings, with all else that survived of the literature of the past, would be destroyed., 'Orwell', '1984'], [these translations were a slow and difficult business, and it was not expected that they would be finished before the first or second decade of the twenty-first century., 'Orwell', '1984'], [there were also large quantities of merely utilitarian literature--indispensable technical manuals, and the like--that had to be treated in the same way., 'Orwell', '1984'], [it was chiefly in order to allow time for the preliminary work of translation that the final adoption of newspeak had been fixed for so late a date as 2050., 'Orwell', '1984']]"

      "chapter i mr. jones, of the manor farm, had locked the hen-houses for the night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes. with the ring of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where mrs. jones was already snoring. as soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a fluttering all through the farm buildings. word had gone round during the day that old major, the prize middle white boar, had had a strange dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals. it had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as mr. jones was safely out of the way. old major (so he was always called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was willingdon beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say. at one end of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, major was already ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam. he was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was still a majestic-looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after their different fashions. first came the three dogs, bluebell, jessie, and pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw immediately in front of the platform. the hens perched themselves on the window-sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. the two cart-horses, boxer and clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be some small animal concealed in the straw. clover was a stout motherly mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal. boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. a white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in fact he was not of first-rate intelligence, but he was universally respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work. after the horses came muriel, the white goat, and benjamin, the donkey. benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. he seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical remark--for instance, he would say that god had given him a tail to keep the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies. alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. if asked why, he would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. nevertheless, without openly admitting it, he was devoted to boxer; the two of them usually spent their sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, grazing side by side and never speaking. the two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be trodden on. clover made a sort of wall round them with her great foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell asleep. at the last moment mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who drew mr. jones's trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of sugar. she took a place near the front and began flirting her white mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with. last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place, and finally squeezed herself in between boxer and clover; there she purred contentedly throughout major's speech without listening to a word of what he was saying. all the animals were now present except moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. when major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting attentively, he cleared his throat and began: \"comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that i had last night. but i will come to the dream later. i have something else to say first. i do not think, comrades, that i shall be with you for many months longer, and before i die, i feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as i have acquired. i have had a long life, i have had much time for thought as i lay alone in my stall, and i think i may say that i understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living. it is about this that i wish to speak to you. \"now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? let us face it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. we are born, we are given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. no animal in england knows the meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. no animal in england is free. the life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is the plain truth. \"but is this simply part of the order of nature? is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who dwell upon it? no, comrades, a thousand times no! the soil of england is fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit it. this single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows, hundreds of sheep--and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that are now almost beyond our imagining. why then do we continue in this miserable condition? because nearly the whole of the produce of our labour is stolen from us by human beings. there, comrades, is the answer to all our problems. it is summed up in a single word--man. man is the only real enemy we have. remove man from the scene, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever. \"man is the only creature that consumes without producing. he does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. yet he is lord of all the animals. he sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself. our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not one of us that owns more than his bare skin. you cows that i see before me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this last year? and what has happened to that milk which should have been breeding up sturdy calves? every drop of it has gone down the throats of our enemies. and you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? the rest have all gone to market to bring in money for jones and his men. and you, clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been the support and pleasure of your old age? each was sold at a year old--you will never see one of them again. in return for your four confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare rations and a stall? \"and even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their natural span. for myself i do not grumble, for i am one of the lucky ones. i am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. such is the natural life of a pig. but no animal escapes the cruel knife in the end. you young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. to that horror we all must come--cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. even the horses and the dogs have no better fate. you, boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, jones will sell you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds. as for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, jones ties a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond. \"is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? only get rid of man, and the produce of our labour would be our own. almost overnight we could become rich and free. what then must we do? why, work night and day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! that is my message to you, comrades: rebellion! i do not know when that rebellion will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but i know, as surely as i see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice will be done. fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short remainder of your lives! and above all, pass on this message of mine to those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the struggle until it is victorious. \"and remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. no argument must lead you astray. never listen when they tell you that man and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one is the prosperity of the others. it is all lies. man serves the interests of no creature except himself. and among us animals let there be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. all men are enemies. all animals are comrades.\" at this moment there was a tremendous uproar. while major was speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting on their hindquarters, listening to him. the dogs had suddenly caught sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives. major raised his trotter for silence. \"comrades,\" he said, \"here is a point that must be settled. the wild creatures, such as rats and rabbits--are they our friends or our enemies? let us put it to the vote. i propose this question to the meeting: are rats comrades?\" the vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming majority that rats were comrades. there were only four dissentients, the three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on both sides. major continued: \"i have little more to say. i merely repeat, remember always your duty of enmity towards man and all his ways. whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. and remember also that in fighting against man, we must not come to resemble him. even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices. no animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes, or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade. all the habits of man are evil. and, above all, no animal must ever tyrannise over his own kind. weak or strong, clever or simple, we are all brothers. no animal must ever kill any other animal. all animals are equal. \"and now, comrades, i will tell you about my dream of last night. i cannot describe that dream to you. it was a dream of the earth as it will be when man has vanished. but it reminded me of something that i had long forgotten. many years ago, when i was a little pig, my mother and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the tune and the first three words. i had known that tune in my infancy, but it had long since passed out of my mind. last night, however, it came back to me in my dream. and what is more, the words of the song also came back-words, i am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been lost to memory for generations. i will sing you that song now, comrades. i am old and my voice is hoarse, but when i have taught you the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. it is called 'beasts of england'.\" old major cleared his throat and began to sing. as he had said, his voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something between 'clementine' and 'la cucaracha'. the words ran: beasts of england, beasts of ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken to my joyful tidings of the golden future time. soon or late the day is coming, tyrant man shall be o'erthrown, and the fruitful fields of england shall be trod by beasts alone. rings shall vanish from our noses, and the harness from our back, bit and spur shall rust forever, cruel whips no more shall crack. riches more than mind can picture, wheat and barley, oats and hay, clover, beans, and mangel-wurzels shall be ours upon that day. bright will shine the fields of england, purer shall its waters be, sweeter yet shall blow its breezes on the day that sets us free. for that day we all must labour, though we die before it break; cows and horses, geese and turkeys, all must toil for freedom's sake. beasts of england, beasts of ireland, beasts of every land and clime, hearken well and spread my tidings of the golden future time. the singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest excitement. almost before major had reached the end, they had begun singing it for themselves. even the stupidest of them had already picked up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few minutes. and then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst out into 'beasts of england' in tremendous unison. the cows lowed it, the dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks quacked it. they were so delighted with the song that they sang it right through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted. unfortunately, the uproar awoke mr. jones, who sprang out of bed, making sure that there was a fox in the yard. he seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. the pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke up hurriedly. everyone fled to his own sleeping-place. the birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment. chapter ii three nights later old major died peacefully in his sleep. his body was buried at the foot of the orchard. this was early in march. during the next three months there was much secret activity. major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals on the farm a completely new outlook on life. they did not know when the rebellion predicted by major would take place, they had no reason for thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly that it was their duty to prepare for it. the work of teaching and organising the others fell naturally upon the pigs, who were generally recognised as being the cleverest of the animals. pre-eminent among the pigs were two young boars named snowball and napoleon, whom mr. jones was breeding up for sale. napoleon was a large, rather fierce-looking berkshire boar, the only berkshire on the farm, not much of a talker, but with a reputation for getting his own way. snowball was a more vivacious pig than napoleon, quicker in speech and more inventive, but was not considered to have the same depth of character. all the other male pigs on the farm were porkers. the best known among them was a small fat pig named squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a shrill voice. he was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking his tail which was somehow very persuasive. the others said of squealer that he could turn black into white. these three had elaborated old major's teachings into a complete system of thought, to which they gave the name of animalism. several nights a week, after mr. jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and expounded the principles of animalism to the others. at the beginning they met with much stupidity and apathy. some of the animals talked of the duty of loyalty to mr. jones, whom they referred to as \"master,\" or made elementary remarks such as \"mr. jones feeds us. if he were gone, we should starve to death.\" others asked such questions as \"why should we care what happens after we are dead?\" or \"if this rebellion is to happen anyway, what difference does it make whether we work for it or not?\", and the pigs had great difficulty in making them see that this was contrary to the spirit of animalism. the stupidest questions of all were asked by mollie, the white mare. the very first question she asked snowball was: \"will there still be sugar after the rebellion?\" \"no,\" said snowball firmly. \"we have no means of making sugar on this farm. besides, you do not need sugar. you will have all the oats and hay you want.\" \"and shall i still be allowed to wear ribbons in my mane?\" asked mollie. \"comrade,\" said snowball, \"those ribbons that you are so devoted to are the badge of slavery. can you not understand that liberty is worth more than ribbons?\" mollie agreed, but she did not sound very convinced. the pigs had an even harder struggle to counteract the lies put about by moses, the tame raven. moses, who was mr. jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker. he claimed to know of the existence of a mysterious country called sugarcandy mountain, to which all animals went when they died. it was situated somewhere up in the sky, a little distance beyond the clouds, moses said. in sugarcandy mountain it was sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges. the animals hated moses because he told tales and did no work, but some of them believed in sugarcandy mountain, and the pigs had to argue very hard to persuade them that there was no such place. their most faithful disciples were the two cart-horses, boxer and clover. these two had great difficulty in thinking anything out for themselves, but having once accepted the pigs as their teachers, they absorbed everything that they were told, and passed it on to the other animals by simple arguments. they were unfailing in their attendance at the secret meetings in the barn, and led the singing of 'beasts of england', with which the meetings always ended. now, as it turned out, the rebellion was achieved much earlier and more easily than anyone had expected. in past years mr. jones, although a hard master, had been a capable farmer, but of late he had fallen on evil days. he had become much disheartened after losing money in a lawsuit, and had taken to drinking more than was good for him. for whole days at a time he would lounge in his windsor chair in the kitchen, reading the newspapers, drinking, and occasionally feeding moses on crusts of bread soaked in beer. his men were idle and dishonest, the fields were full of weeds, the buildings wanted roofing, the hedges were neglected, and the animals were underfed. june came and the hay was almost ready for cutting. on midsummer's eve, which was a saturday, mr. jones went into willingdon and got so drunk at the red lion that he did not come back till midday on sunday. the men had milked the cows in the early morning and then had gone out rabbiting, without bothering to feed the animals. when mr. jones got back he immediately went to sleep on the drawing-room sofa with the news of the world over his face, so that when evening came, the animals were still unfed. at last they could stand it no longer. one of the cows broke in the door of the store-shed with her horn and all the animals began to help themselves from the bins. it was just then that mr. jones woke up. the next moment he and his four men were in the store-shed with whips in their hands, lashing out in all directions. this was more than the hungry animals could bear. with one accord, though nothing of the kind had been planned beforehand, they flung themselves upon their tormentors. jones and his men suddenly found themselves being butted and kicked from all sides. the situation was quite out of their control. they had never seen animals behave like this before, and this sudden uprising of creatures whom they were used to thrashing and maltreating just as they chose, frightened them almost out of their wits. after only a moment or two they gave up trying to defend themselves and took to their heels. a minute later all five of them were in full flight down the cart-track that led to the main road, with the animals pursuing them in triumph. mrs. jones looked out of the bedroom window, saw what was happening, hurriedly flung a few possessions into a carpet bag, and slipped out of the farm by another way. moses sprang off his perch and flapped after her, croaking loudly. meanwhile the animals had chased jones and his men out on to the road and slammed the five-barred gate behind them. and so, almost before they knew what was happening, the rebellion had been successfully carried through: jones was expelled, and the manor farm was theirs. for the first few minutes the animals could hardly believe in their good fortune. their first act was to gallop in a body right round the boundaries of the farm, as though to make quite sure that no human being was hiding anywhere upon it; then they raced back to the farm buildings to wipe out the last traces of jones's hated reign. the harness-room at the end of the stables was broken open; the bits, the nose-rings, the dog-chains, the cruel knives with which mr. jones had been used to castrate the pigs and lambs, were all flung down the well. the reins, the halters, the blinkers, the degrading nosebags, were thrown on to the rubbish fire which was burning in the yard. so were the whips. all the animals capered with joy when they saw the whips going up in flames. snowball also threw on to the fire the ribbons with which the horses' manes and tails had usually been decorated on market days. \"ribbons,\" he said, \"should be considered as clothes, which are the mark of a human being. all animals should go naked.\" when boxer heard this he fetched the small straw hat which he wore in summer to keep the flies out of his ears, and flung it on to the fire with the rest. in a very little while the animals had destroyed everything that reminded them of mr. jones. napoleon then led them back to the store-shed and served out a double ration of corn to everybody, with two biscuits for each dog. then they sang 'beasts of england' from end to end seven times running, and after that they settled down for the night and slept as they had never slept before. but they woke at dawn as usual, and suddenly remembering the glorious thing that had happened, they all raced out into the pasture together. a little way down the pasture there was a knoll that commanded a view of most of the farm. the animals rushed to the top of it and gazed round them in the clear morning light. yes, it was theirs--everything that they could see was theirs! in the ecstasy of that thought they gambolled round and round, they hurled themselves into the air in great leaps of excitement. they rolled in the dew, they cropped mouthfuls of the sweet summer grass, they kicked up clods of the black earth and snuffed its rich scent. then they made a tour of inspection of the whole farm and surveyed with speechless admiration the ploughland, the hayfield, the orchard, the pool, the spinney. it was as though they had never seen these things before, and even now they could hardly believe that it was all their own. then they filed back to the farm buildings and halted in silence outside the door of the farmhouse. that was theirs too, but they were frightened to go inside. after a moment, however, snowball and napoleon butted the door open with their shoulders and the animals entered in single file, walking with the utmost care for fear of disturbing anything. they tiptoed from room to room, afraid to speak above a whisper and gazing with a kind of awe at the unbelievable luxury, at the beds with their feather mattresses, the looking-glasses, the horsehair sofa, the brussels carpet, the lithograph of queen victoria over the drawing-room mantelpiece. they were just coming down the stairs when mollie was discovered to be missing. going back, the others found that she had remained behind in the best bedroom. she had taken a piece of blue ribbon from mrs. jones's dressing-table, and was holding it against her shoulder and admiring herself in the glass in a very foolish manner. the others reproached her sharply, and they went outside. some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial, and the barrel of beer in the scullery was stove in with a kick from boxer's hoof, otherwise nothing in the house was touched. a unanimous resolution was passed on the spot that the farmhouse should be preserved as a museum. all were agreed that no animal must ever live there. the animals had their breakfast, and then snowball and napoleon called them together again. \"comrades,\" said snowball, \"it is half-past six and we have a long day before us. today we begin the hay harvest. but there is another matter that must be attended to first.\" the pigs now revealed that during the past three months they had taught themselves to read and write from an old spelling book which had belonged to mr. jones's children and which had been thrown on the rubbish heap. napoleon sent for pots of black and white paint and led the way down to the five-barred gate that gave on to the main road. then snowball (for it was snowball who was best at writing) took a brush between the two knuckles of his trotter, painted out manor farm from the top bar of the gate and in its place painted animal farm. this was to be the name of the farm from now onwards. after this they went back to the farm buildings, where snowball and napoleon sent for a ladder which they caused to be set against the end wall of the big barn. they explained that by their studies of the past three months the pigs had succeeded in reducing the principles of animalism to seven commandments. these seven commandments would now be inscribed on the wall; they would form an unalterable law by which all the animals on animal farm must live for ever after. with some difficulty (for it is not easy for a pig to balance himself on a ladder) snowball climbed up and set to work, with squealer a few rungs below him holding the paint-pot. the commandments were written on the tarred wall in great white letters that could be read thirty yards away. they ran thus: the seven commandments 1. whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy. 2. whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend. 3. no animal shall wear clothes. 4. no animal shall sleep in a bed. 5. no animal shall drink alcohol. 6. no animal shall kill any other animal. 7. all animals are equal. it was very neatly written, and except that \"friend\" was written \"freind\" and one of the \"s's\" was the wrong way round, the spelling was correct all the way through. snowball read it aloud for the benefit of the others. all the animals nodded in complete agreement, and the cleverer ones at once began to learn the commandments by heart. \"now, comrades,\" cried snowball, throwing down the paint-brush, \"to the hayfield! let us make it a point of honour to get in the harvest more quickly than jones and his men could do.\" but at this moment the three cows, who had seemed uneasy for some time past, set up a loud lowing. they had not been milked for twenty-four hours, and their udders were almost bursting. after a little thought, the pigs sent for buckets and milked the cows fairly successfully, their trotters being well adapted to this task. soon there were five buckets of frothing creamy milk at which many of the animals looked with considerable interest. \"what is going to happen to all that milk?\" said someone. \"jones used sometimes to mix some of it in our mash,\" said one of the hens. \"never mind the milk, comrades!\" cried napoleon, placing himself in front of the buckets. \"that will be attended to. the harvest is more important. comrade snowball will lead the way. i shall follow in a few minutes. forward, comrades! the hay is waiting.\" so the animals trooped down to the hayfield to begin the harvest, and when they came back in the evening it was noticed that the milk had disappeared. chapter iii how they toiled and sweated to get the hay in! but their efforts were rewarded, for the harvest was an even bigger success than they had hoped. sometimes the work was hard; the implements had been designed for human beings and not for animals, and it was a great drawback that no animal was able to use any tool that involved standing on his hind legs. but the pigs were so clever that they could think of a way round every difficulty. as for the horses, they knew every inch of the field, and in fact understood the business of mowing and raking far better than jones and his men had ever done. the pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. with their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership. boxer and clover would harness themselves to the cutter or the horse-rake (no bits or reins were needed in these days, of course) and tramp steadily round and round the field with a pig walking behind and calling out \"gee up, comrade!\" or \"whoa back, comrade!\" as the case might be. and every animal down to the humblest worked at turning the hay and gathering it. even the ducks and hens toiled to and fro all day in the sun, carrying tiny wisps of hay in their beaks. in the end they finished the harvest in two days' less time than it had usually taken jones and his men. moreover, it was the biggest harvest that the farm had ever seen. there was no wastage whatever; the hens and ducks with their sharp eyes had gathered up the very last stalk. and not an animal on the farm had stolen so much as a mouthful. all through that summer the work of the farm went like clockwork. the animals were happy as they had never conceived it possible to be. every mouthful of food was an acute positive pleasure, now that it was truly their own food, produced by themselves and for themselves, not doled out to them by a grudging master. with the worthless parasitical human beings gone, there was more for everyone to eat. there was more leisure too, inexperienced though the animals were. they met with many difficulties--for instance, later in the year, when they harvested the corn, they had to tread it out in the ancient style and blow away the chaff with their breath, since the farm possessed no threshing machine--but the pigs with their cleverness and boxer with his tremendous muscles always pulled them through. boxer was the admiration of everybody. he had been a hard worker even in jones's time, but now he seemed more like three horses than one; there were days when the entire work of the farm seemed to rest on his mighty shoulders. from morning to night he was pushing and pulling, always at the spot where the work was hardest. he had made an arrangement with one of the cockerels to call him in the mornings half an hour earlier than anyone else, and would put in some volunteer labour at whatever seemed to be most needed, before the regular day's work began. his answer to every problem, every setback, was \"i will work harder!\"--which he had adopted as his personal motto. but everyone worked according to his capacity. the hens and ducks, for instance, saved five bushels of corn at the harvest by gathering up the stray grains. nobody stole, nobody grumbled over his rations, the quarrelling and biting and jealousy which had been normal features of life in the old days had almost disappeared. nobody shirked--or almost nobody. mollie, it was true, was not good at getting up in the mornings, and had a way of leaving work early on the ground that there was a stone in her hoof. and the behaviour of the cat was somewhat peculiar. it was soon noticed that when there was work to be done the cat could never be found. she would vanish for hours on end, and then reappear at meal-times, or in the evening after work was over, as though nothing had happened. but she always made such excellent excuses, and purred so affectionately, that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions. old benjamin, the donkey, seemed quite unchanged since the rebellion. he did his work in the same slow obstinate way as he had done it in jones's time, never shirking and never volunteering for extra work either. about the rebellion and its results he would express no opinion. when asked whether he was not happier now that jones was gone, he would say only \"donkeys live a long time. none of you has ever seen a dead donkey,\" and the others had to be content with this cryptic answer. on sundays there was no work. breakfast was an hour later than usual, and after breakfast there was a ceremony which was observed every week without fail. first came the hoisting of the flag. snowball had found in the harness-room an old green tablecloth of mrs. jones's and had painted on it a hoof and a horn in white. this was run up the flagstaff in the farmhouse garden every sunday morning. the flag was green, snowball explained, to represent the green fields of england, while the hoof and horn signified the future republic of the animals which would arise when the human race had been finally overthrown. after the hoisting of the flag all the animals trooped into the big barn for a general assembly which was known as the meeting. here the work of the coming week was planned out and resolutions were put forward and debated. it was always the pigs who put forward the resolutions. the other animals understood how to vote, but could never think of any resolutions of their own. snowball and napoleon were by far the most active in the debates. but it was noticed that these two were never in agreement: whatever suggestion either of them made, the other could be counted on to oppose it. even when it was resolved--a thing no one could object to in itself--to set aside the small paddock behind the orchard as a home of rest for animals who were past work, there was a stormy debate over the correct retiring age for each class of animal. the meeting always ended with the singing of 'beasts of england', and the afternoon was given up to recreation. the pigs had set aside the harness-room as a headquarters for themselves. here, in the evenings, they studied blacksmithing, carpentering, and other necessary arts from books which they had brought out of the farmhouse. snowball also busied himself with organising the other animals into what he called animal committees. he was indefatigable at this. he formed the egg production committee for the hens, the clean tails league for the cows, the wild comrades' re-education committee (the object of this was to tame the rats and rabbits), the whiter wool movement for the sheep, and various others, besides instituting classes in reading and writing. on the whole, these projects were a failure. the attempt to tame the wild creatures, for instance, broke down almost immediately. they continued to behave very much as before, and when treated with generosity, simply took advantage of it. the cat joined the re-education committee and was very active in it for some days. she was seen one day sitting on a roof and talking to some sparrows who were just out of her reach. she was telling them that all animals were now comrades and that any sparrow who chose could come and perch on her paw; but the sparrows kept their distance. the reading and writing classes, however, were a great success. by the autumn almost every animal on the farm was literate in some degree. as for the pigs, they could already read and write perfectly. the dogs learned to read fairly well, but were not interested in reading anything except the seven commandments. muriel, the goat, could read somewhat better than the dogs, and sometimes used to read to the others in the evenings from scraps of newspaper which she found on the rubbish heap. benjamin could read as well as any pig, but never exercised his faculty. so far as he knew, he said, there was nothing worth reading. clover learnt the whole alphabet, but could not put words together. boxer could not get beyond the letter d. he would trace out a, b, c, d, in the dust with his great hoof, and then would stand staring at the letters with his ears back, sometimes shaking his forelock, trying with all his might to remember what came next and never succeeding. on several occasions, indeed, he did learn e, f, g, h, but by the time he knew them, it was always discovered that he had forgotten a, b, c, and d. finally he decided to be content with the first four letters, and used to write them out once or twice every day to refresh his memory. mollie refused to learn any but the six letters which spelt her own name. she would form these very neatly out of pieces of twig, and would then decorate them with a flower or two and walk round them admiring them. none of the other animals on the farm could get further than the letter a. it was also found that the stupider animals, such as the sheep, hens, and ducks, were unable to learn the seven commandments by heart. after much thought snowball declared that the seven commandments could in effect be reduced to a single maxim, namely: \"four legs good, two legs bad.\" this, he said, contained the essential principle of animalism. whoever had thoroughly grasped it would be safe from human influences. the birds at first objected, since it seemed to them that they also had two legs, but snowball proved to them that this was not so. \"a bird's wing, comrades,\" he said, \"is an organ of propulsion and not of manipulation. it should therefore be regarded as a leg. the distinguishing mark of man is the hand, the instrument with which he does all his mischief.\" the birds did not understand snowball's long words, but they accepted his explanation, and all the humbler animals set to work to learn the new maxim by heart. four legs good, two legs bad, was inscribed on the end wall of the barn, above the seven commandments and in bigger letters. when they had once got it by heart, the sheep developed a great liking for this maxim, and often as they lay in the field they would all start bleating \"four legs good, two legs bad! four legs good, two legs bad!\" and keep it up for hours on end, never growing tired of it. napoleon took no interest in snowball's committees. he said that the education of the young was more important than anything that could be done for those who were already grown up. it happened that jessie and bluebell had both whelped soon after the hay harvest, giving birth between them to nine sturdy puppies. as soon as they were weaned, napoleon took them away from their mothers, saying that he would make himself responsible for their education. he took them up into a loft which could only be reached by a ladder from the harness-room, and there kept them in such seclusion that the rest of the farm soon forgot their existence. the mystery of where the milk went to was soon cleared up. it was mixed every day into the pigs' mash. the early apples were now ripening, and the grass of the orchard was littered with windfalls. the animals had assumed as a matter of course that these would be shared out equally; one day, however, the order went forth that all the windfalls were to be collected and brought to the harness-room for the use of the pigs. at this some of the other animals murmured, but it was no use. all the pigs were in full agreement on this point, even snowball and napoleon. squealer was sent to make the necessary explanations to the others. \"comrades!\" he cried. \"you do not imagine, i hope, that we pigs are doing this in a spirit of selfishness and privilege? many of us actually dislike milk and apples. i dislike them myself. our sole object in taking these things is to preserve our health. milk and apples (this has been proved by science, comrades) contain substances absolutely necessary to the well-being of a pig. we pigs are brainworkers. the whole management and organisation of this farm depend on us. day and night we are watching over your welfare. it is for your sake that we drink that milk and eat those apples. do you know what would happen if we pigs failed in our duty? jones would come back! yes, jones would come back! surely, comrades,\" cried squealer almost pleadingly, skipping from side to side and whisking his tail, \"surely there is no one among you who wants to see jones come back?\" now if there was one thing that the animals were completely certain of, it was that they did not want jones back. when it was put to them in this light, they had no more to say. the importance of keeping the pigs in good health was all too obvious. so it was agreed without further argument that the milk and the windfall apples (and also the main crop of apples when they ripened) should be reserved for the pigs alone. chapter iv by the late summer the news of what had happened on animal farm had spread across half the county. every day snowball and napoleon sent out flights of pigeons whose instructions were to mingle with the animals on neighbouring farms, tell them the story of the rebellion, and teach them the tune of 'beasts of england'. most of this time mr. jones had spent sitting in the taproom of the red lion at willingdon, complaining to anyone who would listen of the monstrous injustice he had suffered in being turned out of his property by a pack of good-for-nothing animals. the other farmers sympathised in principle, but they did not at first give him much help. at heart, each of them was secretly wondering whether he could not somehow turn jones's misfortune to his own advantage. it was lucky that the owners of the two farms which adjoined animal farm were on permanently bad terms. one of them, which was named foxwood, was a large, neglected, old-fashioned farm, much overgrown by woodland, with all its pastures worn out and its hedges in a disgraceful condition. its owner, mr. pilkington, was an easy-going gentleman farmer who spent most of his time in fishing or hunting according to the season. the other farm, which was called pinchfield, was smaller and better kept. its owner was a mr. frederick, a tough, shrewd man, perpetually involved in lawsuits and with a name for driving hard bargains. these two disliked each other so much that it was difficult for them to come to any agreement, even in defence of their own interests. nevertheless, they were both thoroughly frightened by the rebellion on animal farm, and very anxious to prevent their own animals from learning too much about it. at first they pretended to laugh to scorn the idea of animals managing a farm for themselves. the whole thing would be over in a fortnight, they said. they put it about that the animals on the manor farm (they insisted on calling it the manor farm; they would not tolerate the name \"animal farm\") were perpetually fighting among themselves and were also rapidly starving to death. when time passed and the animals had evidently not starved to death, frederick and pilkington changed their tune and began to talk of the terrible wickedness that now flourished on animal farm. it was given out that the animals there practised cannibalism, tortured one another with red-hot horseshoes, and had their females in common. this was what came of rebelling against the laws of nature, frederick and pilkington said. however, these stories were never fully believed. rumours of a wonderful farm, where the human beings had been turned out and the animals managed their own affairs, continued to circulate in vague and distorted forms, and throughout that year a wave of rebelliousness ran through the countryside. bulls which had always been tractable suddenly turned savage, sheep broke down hedges and devoured the clover, cows kicked the pail over, hunters refused their fences and shot their riders on to the other side. above all, the tune and even the words of 'beasts of england' were known everywhere. it had spread with astonishing speed. the human beings could not contain their rage when they heard this song, though they pretended to think it merely ridiculous. they could not understand, they said, how even animals could bring themselves to sing such contemptible rubbish. any animal caught singing it was given a flogging on the spot. and yet the song was irrepressible. the blackbirds whistled it in the hedges, the pigeons cooed it in the elms, it got into the din of the smithies and the tune of the church bells. and when the human beings listened to it, they secretly trembled, hearing in it a prophecy of their future doom. early in october, when the corn was cut and stacked and some of it was already threshed, a flight of pigeons came whirling through the air and alighted in the yard of animal farm in the wildest excitement. jones and all his men, with half a dozen others from foxwood and pinchfield, had entered the five-barred gate and were coming up the cart-track that led to the farm. they were all carrying sticks, except jones, who was marching ahead with a gun in his hands. obviously they were going to attempt the recapture of the farm. this had long been expected, and all preparations had been made. snowball, who had studied an old book of julius caesar's campaigns which he had found in the farmhouse, was in charge of the defensive operations. he gave his orders quickly, and in a couple of minutes every animal was at his post. as the human beings approached the farm buildings, snowball launched his first attack. all the pigeons, to the number of thirty-five, flew to and fro over the men's heads and muted upon them from mid-air; and while the men were dealing with this, the geese, who had been hiding behind the hedge, rushed out and pecked viciously at the calves of their legs. however, this was only a light skirmishing manoeuvre, intended to create a little disorder, and the men easily drove the geese off with their sticks. snowball now launched his second line of attack. muriel, benjamin, and all the sheep, with snowball at the head of them, rushed forward and prodded and butted the men from every side, while benjamin turned around and lashed at them with his small hoofs. but once again the men, with their sticks and their hobnailed boots, were too strong for them; and suddenly, at a squeal from snowball, which was the signal for retreat, all the animals turned and fled through the gateway into the yard. the men gave a shout of triumph. they saw, as they imagined, their enemies in flight, and they rushed after them in disorder. this was just what snowball had intended. as soon as they were well inside the yard, the three horses, the three cows, and the rest of the pigs, who had been lying in ambush in the cowshed, suddenly emerged in their rear, cutting them off. snowball now gave the signal for the charge. he himself dashed straight for jones. jones saw him coming, raised his gun and fired. the pellets scored bloody streaks along snowball's back, and a sheep dropped dead. without halting for an instant, snowball flung his fifteen stone against jones's legs. jones was hurled into a pile of dung and his gun flew out of his hands. but the most terrifying spectacle of all was boxer, rearing up on his hind legs and striking out with his great iron-shod hoofs like a stallion. his very first blow took a stable-lad from foxwood on the skull and stretched him lifeless in the mud. at the sight, several men dropped their sticks and tried to run. panic overtook them, and the next moment all the animals together were chasing them round and round the yard. they were gored, kicked, bitten, trampled on. there was not an animal on the farm that did not take vengeance on them after his own fashion. even the cat suddenly leapt off a roof onto a cowman's shoulders and sank her claws in his neck, at which he yelled horribly. at a moment when the opening was clear, the men were glad enough to rush out of the yard and make a bolt for the main road. and so within five minutes of their invasion they were in ignominious retreat by the same way as they had come, with a flock of geese hissing after them and pecking at their calves all the way. all the men were gone except one. back in the yard boxer was pawing with his hoof at the stable-lad who lay face down in the mud, trying to turn him over. the boy did not stir. \"he is dead,\" said boxer sorrowfully. \"i had no intention of doing that. i forgot that i was wearing iron shoes. who will believe that i did not do this on purpose?\" \"no sentimentality, comrade!\" cried snowball from whose wounds the blood was still dripping. \"war is war. the only good human being is a dead one.\" \"i have no wish to take life, not even human life,\" repeated boxer, and his eyes were full of tears. \"where is mollie?\" exclaimed somebody. mollie in fact was missing. for a moment there was great alarm; it was feared that the men might have harmed her in some way, or even carried her off with them. in the end, however, she was found hiding in her stall with her head buried among the hay in the manger. she had taken to flight as soon as the gun went off. and when the others came back from looking for her, it was to find that the stable-lad, who in fact was only stunned, had already recovered and made off. the animals had now reassembled in the wildest excitement, each recounting his own exploits in the battle at the top of his voice. an impromptu celebration of the victory was held immediately. the flag was run up and 'beasts of england' was sung a number of times, then the sheep who had been killed was given a solemn funeral, a hawthorn bush being planted on her grave. at the graveside snowball made a little speech, emphasising the need for all animals to be ready to die for animal farm if need be. the animals decided unanimously to create a military decoration, \"animal hero, first class,\" which was conferred there and then on snowball and boxer. it consisted of a brass medal (they were really some old horse-brasses which had been found in the harness-room), to be worn on sundays and holidays. there was also \"animal hero, second class,\" which was conferred posthumously on the dead sheep. there was much discussion as to what the battle should be called. in the end, it was named the battle of the cowshed, since that was where the ambush had been sprung. mr. jones's gun had been found lying in the mud, and it was known that there was a supply of cartridges in the farmhouse. it was decided to set the gun up at the foot of the flagstaff, like a piece of artillery, and to fire it twice a year--once on october the twelfth, the anniversary of the battle of the cowshed, and once on midsummer day, the anniversary of the rebellion. chapter v as winter drew on, mollie became more and more troublesome. she was late for work every morning and excused herself by saying that she had overslept, and she complained of mysterious pains, although her appetite was excellent. on every kind of pretext she would run away from work and go to the drinking pool, where she would stand foolishly gazing at her own reflection in the water. but there were also rumours of something more serious. one day, as mollie strolled blithely into the yard, flirting her long tail and chewing at a stalk of hay, clover took her aside. \"mollie,\" she said, \"i have something very serious to say to you. this morning i saw you looking over the hedge that divides animal farm from foxwood. one of mr. pilkington's men was standing on the other side of the hedge. and--i was a long way away, but i am almost certain i saw this--he was talking to you and you were allowing him to stroke your nose. what does that mean, mollie?\" \"he didn't! i wasn't! it isn't true!\" cried mollie, beginning to prance about and paw the ground. \"mollie! look me in the face. do you give me your word of honour that that man was not stroking your nose?\" \"it isn't true!\" repeated mollie, but she could not look clover in the face, and the next moment she took to her heels and galloped away into the field. a thought struck clover. without saying anything to the others, she went to mollie's stall and turned over the straw with her hoof. hidden under the straw was a little pile of lump sugar and several bunches of ribbon of different colours. three days later mollie disappeared. for some weeks nothing was known of her whereabouts, then the pigeons reported that they had seen her on the other side of willingdon. she was between the shafts of a smart dogcart painted red and black, which was standing outside a public-house. a fat red-faced man in check breeches and gaiters, who looked like a publican, was stroking her nose and feeding her with sugar. her coat was newly clipped and she wore a scarlet ribbon round her forelock. she appeared to be enjoying herself, so the pigeons said. none of the animals ever mentioned mollie again. in january there came bitterly hard weather. the earth was like iron, and nothing could be done in the fields. many meetings were held in the big barn, and the pigs occupied themselves with planning out the work of the coming season. it had come to be accepted that the pigs, who were manifestly cleverer than the other animals, should decide all questions of farm policy, though their decisions had to be ratified by a majority vote. this arrangement would have worked well enough if it had not been for the disputes between snowball and napoleon. these two disagreed at every point where disagreement was possible. if one of them suggested sowing a bigger acreage with barley, the other was certain to demand a bigger acreage of oats, and if one of them said that such and such a field was just right for cabbages, the other would declare that it was useless for anything except roots. each had his own following, and there were some violent debates. at the meetings snowball often won over the majority by his brilliant speeches, but napoleon was better at canvassing support for himself in between times. he was especially successful with the sheep. of late the sheep had taken to bleating \"four legs good, two legs bad\" both in and out of season, and they often interrupted the meeting with this. it was noticed that they were especially liable to break into \"four legs good, two legs bad\" at crucial moments in snowball's speeches. snowball had made a close study of some back numbers of the 'farmer and stockbreeder' which he had found in the farmhouse, and was full of plans for innovations and improvements. he talked learnedly about field drains, silage, and basic slag, and had worked out a complicated scheme for all the animals to drop their dung directly in the fields, at a different spot every day, to save the labour of cartage. napoleon produced no schemes of his own, but said quietly that snowball's would come to nothing, and seemed to be biding his time. but of all their controversies, none was so bitter as the one that took place over the windmill. in the long pasture, not far from the farm buildings, there was a small knoll which was the highest point on the farm. after surveying the ground, snowball declared that this was just the place for a windmill, which could be made to operate a dynamo and supply the farm with electrical power. this would light the stalls and warm them in winter, and would also run a circular saw, a chaff-cutter, a mangel-slicer, and an electric milking machine. the animals had never heard of anything of this kind before (for the farm was an old-fashioned one and had only the most primitive machinery), and they listened in astonishment while snowball conjured up pictures of fantastic machines which would do their work for them while they grazed at their ease in the fields or improved their minds with reading and conversation. within a few weeks snowball's plans for the windmill were fully worked out. the mechanical details came mostly from three books which had belonged to mr. jones--'one thousand useful things to do about the house', 'every man his own bricklayer', and 'electricity for beginners'. snowball used as his study a shed which had once been used for incubators and had a smooth wooden floor, suitable for drawing on. he was closeted there for hours at a time. with his books held open by a stone, and with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro, drawing in line after line and uttering little whimpers of excitement. gradually the plans grew into a complicated mass of cranks and cog-wheels, covering more than half the floor, which the other animals found completely unintelligible but very impressive. all of them came to look at snowball's drawings at least once a day. even the hens and ducks came, and were at pains not to tread on the chalk marks. only napoleon held aloof. he had declared himself against the windmill from the start. one day, however, he arrived unexpectedly to examine the plans. he walked heavily round the shed, looked closely at every detail of the plans and snuffed at them once or twice, then stood for a little while contemplating them out of the corner of his eye; then suddenly he lifted his leg, urinated over the plans, and walked out without uttering a word. the whole farm was deeply divided on the subject of the windmill. snowball did not deny that to build it would be a difficult business. stone would have to be carried and built up into walls, then the sails would have to be made and after that there would be need for dynamos and cables. (how these were to be procured, snowball did not say.) but he maintained that it could all be done in a year. and thereafter, he declared, so much labour would be saved that the animals would only need to work three days a week. napoleon, on the other hand, argued that the great need of the moment was to increase food production, and that if they wasted time on the windmill they would all starve to death. the animals formed themselves into two factions under the slogan, \"vote for snowball and the three-day week\" and \"vote for napoleon and the full manger.\" benjamin was the only animal who did not side with either faction. he refused to believe either that food would become more plentiful or that the windmill would save work. windmill or no windmill, he said, life would go on as it had always gone on--that is, badly. apart from the disputes over the windmill, there was the question of the defence of the farm. it was fully realised that though the human beings had been defeated in the battle of the cowshed they might make another and more determined attempt to recapture the farm and reinstate mr. jones. they had all the more reason for doing so because the news of their defeat had spread across the countryside and made the animals on the neighbouring farms more restive than ever. as usual, snowball and napoleon were in disagreement. according to napoleon, what the animals must do was to procure firearms and train themselves in the use of them. according to snowball, they must send out more and more pigeons and stir up rebellion among the animals on the other farms. the one argued that if they could not defend themselves they were bound to be conquered, the other argued that if rebellions happened everywhere they would have no need to defend themselves. the animals listened first to napoleon, then to snowball, and could not make up their minds which was right; indeed, they always found themselves in agreement with the one who was speaking at the moment. at last the day came when snowball's plans were completed. at the meeting on the following sunday the question of whether or not to begin work on the windmill was to be put to the vote. when the animals had assembled in the big barn, snowball stood up and, though occasionally interrupted by bleating from the sheep, set forth his reasons for advocating the building of the windmill. then napoleon stood up to reply. he said very quietly that the windmill was nonsense and that he advised nobody to vote for it, and promptly sat down again; he had spoken for barely thirty seconds, and seemed almost indifferent as to the effect he produced. at this snowball sprang to his feet, and shouting down the sheep, who had begun bleating again, broke into a passionate appeal in favour of the windmill. until now the animals had been about equally divided in their sympathies, but in a moment snowball's eloquence had carried them away. in glowing sentences he painted a picture of animal farm as it might be when sordid labour was lifted from the animals' backs. his imagination had now run far beyond chaff-cutters and turnip-slicers. electricity, he said, could operate threshing machines, ploughs, harrows, rollers, and reapers and binders, besides supplying every stall with its own electric light, hot and cold water, and an electric heater. by the time he had finished speaking, there was no doubt as to which way the vote would go. but just at this moment napoleon stood up and, casting a peculiar sidelong look at snowball, uttered a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before. at this there was a terrible baying sound outside, and nine enormous dogs wearing brass-studded collars came bounding into the barn. they dashed straight for snowball, who only sprang from his place just in time to escape their snapping jaws. in a moment he was out of the door and they were after him. too amazed and frightened to speak, all the animals crowded through the door to watch the chase. snowball was racing across the long pasture that led to the road. he was running as only a pig can run, but the dogs were close on his heels. suddenly he slipped and it seemed certain that they had him. then he was up again, running faster than ever, then the dogs were gaining on him again. one of them all but closed his jaws on snowball's tail, but snowball whisked it free just in time. then he put on an extra spurt and, with a few inches to spare, slipped through a hole in the hedge and was seen no more. silent and terrified, the animals crept back into the barn. in a moment the dogs came bounding back. at first no one had been able to imagine where these creatures came from, but the problem was soon solved: they were the puppies whom napoleon had taken away from their mothers and reared privately. though not yet full-grown, they were huge dogs, and as fierce-looking as wolves. they kept close to napoleon. it was noticed that they wagged their tails to him in the same way as the other dogs had been used to do to mr. jones. napoleon, with the dogs following him, now mounted on to the raised portion of the floor where major had previously stood to deliver his speech. he announced that from now on the sunday-morning meetings would come to an end. they were unnecessary, he said, and wasted time. in future all questions relating to the working of the farm would be settled by a special committee of pigs, presided over by himself. these would meet in private and afterwards communicate their decisions to the others. the animals would still assemble on sunday mornings to salute the flag, sing 'beasts of england', and receive their orders for the week; but there would be no more debates. in spite of the shock that snowball's expulsion had given them, the animals were dismayed by this announcement. several of them would have protested if they could have found the right arguments. even boxer was vaguely troubled. he set his ears back, shook his forelock several times, and tried hard to marshal his thoughts; but in the end he could not think of anything to say. some of the pigs themselves, however, were more articulate. four young porkers in the front row uttered shrill squeals of disapproval, and all four of them sprang to their feet and began speaking at once. but suddenly the dogs sitting round napoleon let out deep, menacing growls, and the pigs fell silent and sat down again. then the sheep broke out into a tremendous bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad!\" which went on for nearly a quarter of an hour and put an end to any chance of discussion. afterwards squealer was sent round the farm to explain the new arrangement to the others. \"comrades,\" he said, \"i trust that every animal here appreciates the sacrifice that comrade napoleon has made in taking this extra labour upon himself. do not imagine, comrades, that leadership is a pleasure! on the contrary, it is a deep and heavy responsibility. no one believes more firmly than comrade napoleon that all animals are equal. he would be only too happy to let you make your decisions for yourselves. but sometimes you might make the wrong decisions, comrades, and then where should we be? suppose you had decided to follow snowball, with his moonshine of windmills--snowball, who, as we now know, was no better than a criminal?\" \"he fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed,\" said somebody. \"bravery is not enough,\" said squealer. \"loyalty and obedience are more important. and as to the battle of the cowshed, i believe the time will come when we shall find that snowball's part in it was much exaggerated. discipline, comrades, iron discipline! that is the watchword for today. one false step, and our enemies would be upon us. surely, comrades, you do not want jones back?\" once again this argument was unanswerable. certainly the animals did not want jones back; if the holding of debates on sunday mornings was liable to bring him back, then the debates must stop. boxer, who had now had time to think things over, voiced the general feeling by saying: \"if comrade napoleon says it, it must be right.\" and from then on he adopted the maxim, \"napoleon is always right,\" in addition to his private motto of \"i will work harder.\" by this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun. the shed where snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. every sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to receive their orders for the week. the skull of old major, now clean of flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. after the hoisting of the flag, the animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before entering the barn. nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done in the past. napoleon, with squealer and another pig named minimus, who had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of the raised platform, with the nine young dogs forming a semicircle round them, and the other pigs sitting behind. the rest of the animals sat facing them in the main body of the barn. napoleon read out the orders for the week in a gruff soldierly style, and after a single singing of 'beasts of england', all the animals dispersed. on the third sunday after snowball's expulsion, the animals were somewhat surprised to hear napoleon announce that the windmill was to be built after all. he did not give any reason for having changed his mind, but merely warned the animals that this extra task would mean very hard work, it might even be necessary to reduce their rations. the plans, however, had all been prepared, down to the last detail. a special committee of pigs had been at work upon them for the past three weeks. the building of the windmill, with various other improvements, was expected to take two years. that evening squealer explained privately to the other animals that napoleon had never in reality been opposed to the windmill. on the contrary, it was he who had advocated it in the beginning, and the plan which snowball had drawn on the floor of the incubator shed had actually been stolen from among napoleon's papers. the windmill was, in fact, napoleon's own creation. why, then, asked somebody, had he spoken so strongly against it? here squealer looked very sly. that, he said, was comrade napoleon's cunning. he had seemed to oppose the windmill, simply as a manoeuvre to get rid of snowball, who was a dangerous character and a bad influence. now that snowball was out of the way, the plan could go forward without his interference. this, said squealer, was something called tactics. he repeated a number of times, \"tactics, comrades, tactics!\" skipping round and whisking his tail with a merry laugh. the animals were not certain what the word meant, but squealer spoke so persuasively, and the three dogs who happened to be with him growled so threateningly, that they accepted his explanation without further questions. chapter vi all that year the animals worked like slaves. but they were happy in their work; they grudged no effort or sacrifice, well aware that everything that they did was for the benefit of themselves and those of their kind who would come after them, and not for a pack of idle, thieving human beings. throughout the spring and summer they worked a sixty-hour week, and in august napoleon announced that there would be work on sunday afternoons as well. this work was strictly voluntary, but any animal who absented himself from it would have his rations reduced by half. even so, it was found necessary to leave certain tasks undone. the harvest was a little less successful than in the previous year, and two fields which should have been sown with roots in the early summer were not sown because the ploughing had not been completed early enough. it was possible to foresee that the coming winter would be a hard one. the windmill presented unexpected difficulties. there was a good quarry of limestone on the farm, and plenty of sand and cement had been found in one of the outhouses, so that all the materials for building were at hand. but the problem the animals could not at first solve was how to break up the stone into pieces of suitable size. there seemed no way of doing this except with picks and crowbars, which no animal could use, because no animal could stand on his hind legs. only after weeks of vain effort did the right idea occur to somebody-namely, to utilise the force of gravity. huge boulders, far too big to be used as they were, were lying all over the bed of the quarry. the animals lashed ropes round these, and then all together, cows, horses, sheep, any animal that could lay hold of the rope--even the pigs sometimes joined in at critical moments--they dragged them with desperate slowness up the slope to the top of the quarry, where they were toppled over the edge, to shatter to pieces below. transporting the stone when it was once broken was comparatively simple. the horses carried it off in cart-loads, the sheep dragged single blocks, even muriel and benjamin yoked themselves into an old governess-cart and did their share. by late summer a sufficient store of stone had accumulated, and then the building began, under the superintendence of the pigs. but it was a slow, laborious process. frequently it took a whole day of exhausting effort to drag a single boulder to the top of the quarry, and sometimes when it was pushed over the edge it failed to break. nothing could have been achieved without boxer, whose strength seemed equal to that of all the rest of the animals put together. when the boulder began to slip and the animals cried out in despair at finding themselves dragged down the hill, it was always boxer who strained himself against the rope and brought the boulder to a stop. to see him toiling up the slope inch by inch, his breath coming fast, the tips of his hoofs clawing at the ground, and his great sides matted with sweat, filled everyone with admiration. clover warned him sometimes to be careful not to overstrain himself, but boxer would never listen to her. his two slogans, \"i will work harder\" and \"napoleon is always right,\" seemed to him a sufficient answer to all problems. he had made arrangements with the cockerel to call him three-quarters of an hour earlier in the mornings instead of half an hour. and in his spare moments, of which there were not many nowadays, he would go alone to the quarry, collect a load of broken stone, and drag it down to the site of the windmill unassisted. the animals were not badly off throughout that summer, in spite of the hardness of their work. if they had no more food than they had had in jones's day, at least they did not have less. the advantage of only having to feed themselves, and not having to support five extravagant human beings as well, was so great that it would have taken a lot of failures to outweigh it. and in many ways the animal method of doing things was more efficient and saved labour. such jobs as weeding, for instance, could be done with a thoroughness impossible to human beings. and again, since no animal now stole, it was unnecessary to fence off pasture from arable land, which saved a lot of labour on the upkeep of hedges and gates. nevertheless, as the summer wore on, various unforeseen shortages began to make them selves felt. there was need of paraffin oil, nails, string, dog biscuits, and iron for the horses' shoes, none of which could be produced on the farm. later there would also be need for seeds and artificial manures, besides various tools and, finally, the machinery for the windmill. how these were to be procured, no one was able to imagine. one sunday morning, when the animals assembled to receive their orders, napoleon announced that he had decided upon a new policy. from now onwards animal farm would engage in trade with the neighbouring farms: not, of course, for any commercial purpose, but simply in order to obtain certain materials which were urgently necessary. the needs of the windmill must override everything else, he said. he was therefore making arrangements to sell a stack of hay and part of the current year's wheat crop, and later on, if more money were needed, it would have to be made up by the sale of eggs, for which there was always a market in willingdon. the hens, said napoleon, should welcome this sacrifice as their own special contribution towards the building of the windmill. once again the animals were conscious of a vague uneasiness. never to have any dealings with human beings, never to engage in trade, never to make use of money--had not these been among the earliest resolutions passed at that first triumphant meeting after jones was expelled? all the animals remembered passing such resolutions: or at least they thought that they remembered it. the four young pigs who had protested when napoleon abolished the meetings raised their voices timidly, but they were promptly silenced by a tremendous growling from the dogs. then, as usual, the sheep broke into \"four legs good, two legs bad!\" and the momentary awkwardness was smoothed over. finally napoleon raised his trotter for silence and announced that he had already made all the arrangements. there would be no need for any of the animals to come in contact with human beings, which would clearly be most undesirable. he intended to take the whole burden upon his own shoulders. a mr. whymper, a solicitor living in willingdon, had agreed to act as intermediary between animal farm and the outside world, and would visit the farm every monday morning to receive his instructions. napoleon ended his speech with his usual cry of \"long live animal farm!\" and after the singing of 'beasts of england' the animals were dismissed. afterwards squealer made a round of the farm and set the animals' minds at rest. he assured them that the resolution against engaging in trade and using money had never been passed, or even suggested. it was pure imagination, probably traceable in the beginning to lies circulated by snowball. a few animals still felt faintly doubtful, but squealer asked them shrewdly, \"are you certain that this is not something that you have dreamed, comrades? have you any record of such a resolution? is it written down anywhere?\" and since it was certainly true that nothing of the kind existed in writing, the animals were satisfied that they had been mistaken. every monday mr. whymper visited the farm as had been arranged. he was a sly-looking little man with side whiskers, a solicitor in a very small way of business, but sharp enough to have realised earlier than anyone else that animal farm would need a broker and that the commissions would be worth having. the animals watched his coming and going with a kind of dread, and avoided him as much as possible. nevertheless, the sight of napoleon, on all fours, delivering orders to whymper, who stood on two legs, roused their pride and partly reconciled them to the new arrangement. their relations with the human race were now not quite the same as they had been before. the human beings did not hate animal farm any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. every human being held it as an article of faith that the farm would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. they would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. and yet, against their will, they had developed a certain respect for the efficiency with which the animals were managing their own affairs. one symptom of this was that they had begun to call animal farm by its proper name and ceased to pretend that it was called the manor farm. they had also dropped their championship of jones, who had given up hope of getting his farm back and gone to live in another part of the county. except through whymper, there was as yet no contact between animal farm and the outside world, but there were constant rumours that napoleon was about to enter into a definite business agreement either with mr. pilkington of foxwood or with mr. frederick of pinchfield--but never, it was noticed, with both simultaneously. it was about this time that the pigs suddenly moved into the farmhouse and took up their residence there. again the animals seemed to remember that a resolution against this had been passed in the early days, and again squealer was able to convince them that this was not the case. it was absolutely necessary, he said, that the pigs, who were the brains of the farm, should have a quiet place to work in. it was also more suited to the dignity of the leader (for of late he had taken to speaking of napoleon under the title of \"leader\") to live in a house than in a mere sty. nevertheless, some of the animals were disturbed when they heard that the pigs not only took their meals in the kitchen and used the drawing-room as a recreation room, but also slept in the beds. boxer passed it off as usual with \"napoleon is always right!\", but clover, who thought she remembered a definite ruling against beds, went to the end of the barn and tried to puzzle out the seven commandments which were inscribed there. finding herself unable to read more than individual letters, she fetched muriel. \"muriel,\" she said, \"read me the fourth commandment. does it not say something about never sleeping in a bed?\" with some difficulty muriel spelt it out. \"it says, 'no animal shall sleep in a bed with sheets,\"' she announced finally. curiously enough, clover had not remembered that the fourth commandment mentioned sheets; but as it was there on the wall, it must have done so. and squealer, who happened to be passing at this moment, attended by two or three dogs, was able to put the whole matter in its proper perspective. \"you have heard then, comrades,\" he said, \"that we pigs now sleep in the beds of the farmhouse? and why not? you did not suppose, surely, that there was ever a ruling against beds? a bed merely means a place to sleep in. a pile of straw in a stall is a bed, properly regarded. the rule was against sheets, which are a human invention. we have removed the sheets from the farmhouse beds, and sleep between blankets. and very comfortable beds they are too! but not more comfortable than we need, i can tell you, comrades, with all the brainwork we have to do nowadays. you would not rob us of our repose, would you, comrades? you would not have us too tired to carry out our duties? surely none of you wishes to see jones back?\" the animals reassured him on this point immediately, and no more was said about the pigs sleeping in the farmhouse beds. and when, some days afterwards, it was announced that from now on the pigs would get up an hour later in the mornings than the other animals, no complaint was made about that either. by the autumn the animals were tired but happy. they had had a hard year, and after the sale of part of the hay and corn, the stores of food for the winter were none too plentiful, but the windmill compensated for everything. it was almost half built now. after the harvest there was a stretch of clear dry weather, and the animals toiled harder than ever, thinking it well worth while to plod to and fro all day with blocks of stone if by doing so they could raise the walls another foot. boxer would even come out at nights and work for an hour or two on his own by the light of the harvest moon. in their spare moments the animals would walk round and round the half-finished mill, admiring the strength and perpendicularity of its walls and marvelling that they should ever have been able to build anything so imposing. only old benjamin refused to grow enthusiastic about the windmill, though, as usual, he would utter nothing beyond the cryptic remark that donkeys live a long time. november came, with raging south-west winds. building had to stop because it was now too wet to mix the cement. finally there came a night when the gale was so violent that the farm buildings rocked on their foundations and several tiles were blown off the roof of the barn. the hens woke up squawking with terror because they had all dreamed simultaneously of hearing a gun go off in the distance. in the morning the animals came out of their stalls to find that the flagstaff had been blown down and an elm tree at the foot of the orchard had been plucked up like a radish. they had just noticed this when a cry of despair broke from every animal's throat. a terrible sight had met their eyes. the windmill was in ruins. with one accord they dashed down to the spot. napoleon, who seldom moved out of a walk, raced ahead of them all. yes, there it lay, the fruit of all their struggles, levelled to its foundations, the stones they had broken and carried so laboriously scattered all around. unable at first to speak, they stood gazing mournfully at the litter of fallen stone. napoleon paced to and fro in silence, occasionally snuffing at the ground. his tail had grown rigid and twitched sharply from side to side, a sign in him of intense mental activity. suddenly he halted as though his mind were made up. \"comrades,\" he said quietly, \"do you know who is responsible for this? do you know the enemy who has come in the night and overthrown our windmill? snowball!\" he suddenly roared in a voice of thunder. \"snowball has done this thing! in sheer malignity, thinking to set back our plans and avenge himself for his ignominious expulsion, this traitor has crept here under cover of night and destroyed our work of nearly a year. comrades, here and now i pronounce the death sentence upon snowball. 'animal hero, second class,' and half a bushel of apples to any animal who brings him to justice. a full bushel to anyone who captures him alive!\" the animals were shocked beyond measure to learn that even snowball could be guilty of such an action. there was a cry of indignation, and everyone began thinking out ways of catching snowball if he should ever come back. almost immediately the footprints of a pig were discovered in the grass at a little distance from the knoll. they could only be traced for a few yards, but appeared to lead to a hole in the hedge. napoleon snuffed deeply at them and pronounced them to be snowball's. he gave it as his opinion that snowball had probably come from the direction of foxwood farm. \"no more delays, comrades!\" cried napoleon when the footprints had been examined. \"there is work to be done. this very morning we begin rebuilding the windmill, and we will build all through the winter, rain or shine. we will teach this miserable traitor that he cannot undo our work so easily. remember, comrades, there must be no alteration in our plans: they shall be carried out to the day. forward, comrades! long live the windmill! long live animal farm!\" chapter vii it was a bitter winter. the stormy weather was followed by sleet and snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into february. the animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill were not finished on time. out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was snowball who had destroyed the windmill: they said that it had fallen down because the walls were too thin. the animals knew that this was not the case. still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting much larger quantities of stone. for a long time the quarry was full of snowdrifts and nothing could be done. some progress was made in the dry frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. they were always cold, and usually hungry as well. only boxer and clover never lost heart. squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in boxer's strength and his never-failing cry of \"i will work harder!\" in january food fell short. the corn ration was drastically reduced, and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make up for it. then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly enough. the potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few were edible. for days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff and mangels. starvation seemed to stare them in the face. it was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world. emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were inventing fresh lies about animal farm. once again it was being put about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to cannibalism and infanticide. napoleon was well aware of the bad results that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known, and he decided to make use of mr. whymper to spread a contrary impression. hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals, mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that rations had been increased. in addition, napoleon ordered the almost empty bins in the store-shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand, which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. on some suitable pretext whymper was led through the store-shed and allowed to catch a glimpse of the bins. he was deceived, and continued to report to the outside world that there was no food shortage on animal farm. nevertheless, towards the end of january it became obvious that it would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. in these days napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce-looking dogs. when he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near. frequently he did not even appear on sunday mornings, but issued his orders through one of the other pigs, usually squealer. one sunday morning squealer announced that the hens, who had just come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. napoleon had accepted, through whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. the price of these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till summer came on and conditions were easier. when the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. they had been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not believed that it would really happen. they were just getting their clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take the eggs away now was murder. for the first time since the expulsion of jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. led by three young black minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart napoleon's wishes. their method was to fly up to the rafters and there lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. napoleon acted swiftly and ruthlessly. he ordered the hens' rations to be stopped, and decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen should be punished by death. the dogs saw to it that these orders were carried out. for five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and went back to their nesting boxes. nine hens had died in the meantime. their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they had died of coccidiosis. whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the eggs were duly delivered, a grocer's van driving up to the farm once a week to take them away. all this while no more had been seen of snowball. he was rumoured to be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either foxwood or pinchfield. napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the other farmers than before. it happened that there was in the yard a pile of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech spinney was cleared. it was well seasoned, and whymper had advised napoleon to sell it; both mr. pilkington and mr. frederick were anxious to buy it. napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up his mind. it was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming to an agreement with frederick, snowball was declared to be in hiding at foxwood, while, when he inclined toward pilkington, snowball was said to be at pinchfield. suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered. snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! the animals were so disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. every night, it was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all kinds of mischief. he stole the corn, he upset the milk-pails, he broke the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit trees. whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to snowball. if a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was certain to say that snowball had come in the night and done it, and when the key of the store-shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that snowball had thrown it down the well. curiously enough, they went on believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of meal. the cows declared unanimously that snowball crept into their stalls and milked them in their sleep. the rats, which had been troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with snowball. napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into snowball's activities. with his dogs in attendance he set out and made a careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals following at a respectful distance. at every few steps napoleon stopped and snuffed the ground for traces of snowball's footsteps, which, he said, he could detect by the smell. he snuffed in every corner, in the barn, in the cow-shed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and found traces of snowball almost everywhere. he would put his snout to the ground, give several deep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice, \"snowball! he has been here! i can smell him distinctly!\" and at the word \"snowball\" all the dogs let out blood-curdling growls and showed their side teeth. the animals were thoroughly frightened. it seemed to them as though snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. in the evening squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his face told them that he had some serious news to report. \"comrades!\" cried squealer, making little nervous skips, \"a most terrible thing has been discovered. snowball has sold himself to frederick of pinchfield farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and take our farm away from us! snowball is to act as his guide when the attack begins. but there is worse than that. we had thought that snowball's rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. but we were wrong, comrades. do you know what the real reason was? snowball was in league with jones from the very start! he was jones's secret agent all the time. it has all been proved by documents which he left behind him and which we have only just discovered. to my mind this explains a great deal, comrades. did we not see for ourselves how he attempted--fortunately without success--to get us defeated and destroyed at the battle of the cowshed?\" the animals were stupefied. this was a wickedness far outdoing snowball's destruction of the windmill. but it was some minutes before they could fully take it in. they all remembered, or thought they remembered, how they had seen snowball charging ahead of them at the battle of the cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets from jones's gun had wounded his back. at first it was a little difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on jones's side. even boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. he lay down, tucked his fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to formulate his thoughts. \"i do not believe that,\" he said. \"snowball fought bravely at the battle of the cowshed. i saw him myself. did we not give him 'animal hero, first class,' immediately afterwards?\" \"that was our mistake, comrade. for we know now--it is all written down in the secret documents that we have found--that in reality he was trying to lure us to our doom.\" \"but he was wounded,\" said boxer. \"we all saw him running with blood.\" \"that was part of the arrangement!\" cried squealer. \"jones's shot only grazed him. i could show you this in his own writing, if you were able to read it. the plot was for snowball, at the critical moment, to give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. and he very nearly succeeded--i will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if it had not been for our heroic leader, comrade napoleon. do you not remember how, just at the moment when jones and his men had got inside the yard, snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed him? and do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that comrade napoleon sprang forward with a cry of 'death to humanity!' and sank his teeth in jones's leg? surely you remember that, comrades?\" exclaimed squealer, frisking from side to side. now when squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to the animals that they did remember it. at any rate, they remembered that at the critical moment of the battle snowball had turned to flee. but boxer was still a little uneasy. \"i do not believe that snowball was a traitor at the beginning,\" he said finally. \"what he has done since is different. but i believe that at the battle of the cowshed he was a good comrade.\" \"our leader, comrade napoleon,\" announced squealer, speaking very slowly and firmly, \"has stated categorically--categorically, comrade--that snowball was jones's agent from the very beginning--yes, and from long before the rebellion was ever thought of.\" \"ah, that is different!\" said boxer. \"if comrade napoleon says it, it must be right.\" \"that is the true spirit, comrade!\" cried squealer, but it was noticed he cast a very ugly look at boxer with his little twinkling eyes. he turned to go, then paused and added impressively: \"i warn every animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. for we have reason to think that some of snowball's secret agents are lurking among us at this moment!\" four days later, in the late afternoon, napoleon ordered all the animals to assemble in the yard. when they were all gathered together, napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had recently awarded himself \"animal hero, first class\", and \"animal hero, second class\"), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering growls that sent shivers down all the animals' spines. they all cowered silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible thing was about to happen. napoleon stood sternly surveying his audience; then he uttered a high-pitched whimper. immediately the dogs bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them, squealing with pain and terror, to napoleon's feet. the pigs' ears were bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared to go quite mad. to the amazement of everybody, three of them flung themselves upon boxer. boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof, caught a dog in mid-air, and pinned him to the ground. the dog shrieked for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs. boxer looked at napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to death or let it go. napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply ordered boxer to let the dog go, whereat boxer lifted his hoof, and the dog slunk away, bruised and howling. presently the tumult died down. the four pigs waited, trembling, with guilt written on every line of their countenances. napoleon now called upon them to confess their crimes. they were the same four pigs as had protested when napoleon abolished the sunday meetings. without any further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch with snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an agreement with him to hand over animal farm to mr. frederick. they added that snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been jones's secret agent for years past. when they had finished their confession, the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess. the three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over the eggs now came forward and stated that snowball had appeared to them in a dream and incited them to disobey napoleon's orders. they, too, were slaughtered. then a goose came forward and confessed to having secreted six ears of corn during the last year's harvest and eaten them in the night. then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking pool--urged to do this, so she said, by snowball--and two other sheep confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower of napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was suffering from a cough. they were all slain on the spot. and so the tale of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses lying before napoleon's feet and the air was heavy with the smell of blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of jones. when it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and dogs, crept away in a body. they were shaken and miserable. they did not know which was more shocking--the treachery of the animals who had leagued themselves with snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just witnessed. in the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now that it was happening among themselves. since jones had left the farm, until today, no animal had killed another animal. not even a rat had been killed. they had made their way on to the little knoll where the half-finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as though huddling together for warmth--clover, muriel, benjamin, the cows, the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens--everyone, indeed, except the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before napoleon ordered the animals to assemble. for some time nobody spoke. only boxer remained on his feet. he fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. finally he said: \"i do not understand it. i would not have believed that such things could happen on our farm. it must be due to some fault in ourselves. the solution, as i see it, is to work harder. from now onwards i shall get up a full hour earlier in the mornings.\" and he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry. having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged them down to the windmill before retiring for the night. the animals huddled about clover, not speaking. the knoll where they were lying gave them a wide prospect across the countryside. most of animal farm was within their view--the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings with the smoke curling from the chimneys. it was a clear spring evening. the grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the sun. never had the farm--and with a kind of surprise they remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property--appeared to the animals so desirable a place. as clover looked down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. if she could have spoken her thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race. these scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked forward to on that night when old major first stirred them to rebellion. if she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of major's speech. instead--she did not know why--they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. there was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. she knew that, even as things were, they were far better off than they had been in the days of jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of napoleon. but still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. it was not for this that they had built the windmill and faced the bullets of jones's gun. such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them. at last, feeling this to be in some way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing 'beasts of england'. the other animals sitting round her took it up, and they sang it three times over--very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully, in a way they had never sung it before. they had just finished singing it for the third time when squealer, attended by two dogs, approached them with the air of having something important to say. he announced that, by a special decree of comrade napoleon, 'beasts of england' had been abolished. from now onwards it was forbidden to sing it. the animals were taken aback. \"why?\" cried muriel. \"it's no longer needed, comrade,\" said squealer stiffly. \"'beasts of england' was the song of the rebellion. but the rebellion is now completed. the execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final act. the enemy both external and internal has been defeated. in 'beasts of england' we expressed our longing for a better society in days to come. but that society has now been established. clearly this song has no longer any purpose.\" frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad,\" which went on for several minutes and put an end to the discussion. so 'beasts of england' was heard no more. in its place minimus, the poet, had composed another song which began: animal farm, animal farm, never through me shalt thou come to harm! and this was sung every sunday morning after the hoisting of the flag. but somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the animals to come up to 'beasts of england'. chapter viii a few days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died down, some of the animals remembered--or thought they remembered--that the sixth commandment decreed \"no animal shall kill any other animal.\" and though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square with this. clover asked benjamin to read her the sixth commandment, and when benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters, she fetched muriel. muriel read the commandment for her. it ran: \"no animal shall kill any other animal without cause.\" somehow or other, the last two words had slipped out of the animals' memory. but they saw now that the commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with snowball. throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had worked in the previous year. to rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. there were times when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no better than they had done in jones's day. on sunday mornings squealer, holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent, or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. the animals saw no reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember very clearly what conditions had been like before the rebellion. all the same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had less figures and more food. all orders were now issued through squealer or one of the other pigs. napoleon himself was not seen in public as often as once in a fortnight. when he did appear, he was attended not only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud \"cock-a-doodle-doo\" before napoleon spoke. even in the farmhouse, it was said, napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others. he took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate from the crown derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard in the drawing-room. it was also announced that the gun would be fired every year on napoleon's birthday, as well as on the other two anniversaries. napoleon was now never spoken of simply as \"napoleon.\" he was always referred to in formal style as \"our leader, comrade napoleon,\" and this pigs liked to invent for him such titles as father of all animals, terror of mankind, protector of the sheep-fold, ducklings' friend, and the like. in his speeches, squealer would talk with the tears rolling down his cheeks of napoleon's wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms. it had become usual to give napoleon the credit for every successful achievement and every stroke of good fortune. you would often hear one hen remark to another, \"under the guidance of our leader, comrade napoleon, i have laid five eggs in six days\"; or two cows, enjoying a drink at the pool, would exclaim, \"thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!\" the general feeling on the farm was well expressed in a poem entitled comrade napoleon, which was composed by minimus and which ran as follows: friend of fatherless! fountain of happiness! lord of the swill-bucket! oh, how my soul is on fire when i gaze at thy calm and commanding eye, like the sun in the sky, comrade napoleon! thou are the giver of all that thy creatures love, full belly twice a day, clean straw to roll upon; every beast great or small sleeps at peace in his stall, thou watchest over all, comrade napoleon! had i a sucking-pig, ere he had grown as big even as a pint bottle or as a rolling-pin, he should have learned to be faithful and true to thee, yes, his first squeak should be \"comrade napoleon!\" napoleon approved of this poem and caused it to be inscribed on the wall of the big barn, at the opposite end from the seven commandments. it was surmounted by a portrait of napoleon, in profile, executed by squealer in white paint. meanwhile, through the agency of whymper, napoleon was engaged in complicated negotiations with frederick and pilkington. the pile of timber was still unsold. of the two, frederick was the more anxious to get hold of it, but he would not offer a reasonable price. at the same time there were renewed rumours that frederick and his men were plotting to attack animal farm and to destroy the windmill, the building of which had aroused furious jealousy in him. snowball was known to be still skulking on pinchfield farm. in the middle of the summer the animals were alarmed to hear that three hens had come forward and confessed that, inspired by snowball, they had entered into a plot to murder napoleon. they were executed immediately, and fresh precautions for napoleon's safety were taken. four dogs guarded his bed at night, one at each corner, and a young pig named pinkeye was given the task of tasting all his food before he ate it, lest it should be poisoned. at about the same time it was given out that napoleon had arranged to sell the pile of timber to mr. pilkington; he was also going to enter into a regular agreement for the exchange of certain products between animal farm and foxwood. the relations between napoleon and pilkington, though they were only conducted through whymper, were now almost friendly. the animals distrusted pilkington, as a human being, but greatly preferred him to frederick, whom they both feared and hated. as the summer wore on, and the windmill neared completion, the rumours of an impending treacherous attack grew stronger and stronger. frederick, it was said, intended to bring against them twenty men all armed with guns, and he had already bribed the magistrates and police, so that if he could once get hold of the title-deeds of animal farm they would ask no questions. moreover, terrible stories were leaking out from pinchfield about the cruelties that frederick practised upon his animals. he had flogged an old horse to death, he starved his cows, he had killed a dog by throwing it into the furnace, he amused himself in the evenings by making cocks fight with splinters of razor-blade tied to their spurs. the animals' blood boiled with rage when they heard of these things being done to their comrades, and sometimes they clamoured to be allowed to go out in a body and attack pinchfield farm, drive out the humans, and set the animals free. but squealer counselled them to avoid rash actions and trust in comrade napoleon's strategy. nevertheless, feeling against frederick continued to run high. one sunday morning napoleon appeared in the barn and explained that he had never at any time contemplated selling the pile of timber to frederick; he considered it beneath his dignity, he said, to have dealings with scoundrels of that description. the pigeons who were still sent out to spread tidings of the rebellion were forbidden to set foot anywhere on foxwood, and were also ordered to drop their former slogan of \"death to humanity\" in favour of \"death to frederick.\" in the late summer yet another of snowball's machinations was laid bare. the wheat crop was full of weeds, and it was discovered that on one of his nocturnal visits snowball had mixed weed seeds with the seed corn. a gander who had been privy to the plot had confessed his guilt to squealer and immediately committed suicide by swallowing deadly nightshade berries. the animals now also learned that snowball had never--as many of them had believed hitherto--received the order of \"animal hero, first class.\" this was merely a legend which had been spread some time after the battle of the cowshed by snowball himself. so far from being decorated, he had been censured for showing cowardice in the battle. once again some of the animals heard this with a certain bewilderment, but squealer was soon able to convince them that their memories had been at fault. in the autumn, by a tremendous, exhausting effort--for the harvest had to be gathered at almost the same time--the windmill was finished. the machinery had still to be installed, and whymper was negotiating the purchase of it, but the structure was completed. in the teeth of every difficulty, in spite of inexperience, of primitive implements, of bad luck and of snowball's treachery, the work had been finished punctually to the very day! tired out but proud, the animals walked round and round their masterpiece, which appeared even more beautiful in their eyes than when it had been built the first time. moreover, the walls were twice as thick as before. nothing short of explosives would lay them low this time! and when they thought of how they had laboured, what discouragements they had overcome, and the enormous difference that would be made in their lives when the sails were turning and the dynamos running--when they thought of all this, their tiredness forsook them and they gambolled round and round the windmill, uttering cries of triumph. napoleon himself, attended by his dogs and his cockerel, came down to inspect the completed work; he personally congratulated the animals on their achievement, and announced that the mill would be named napoleon mill. two days later the animals were called together for a special meeting in the barn. they were struck dumb with surprise when napoleon announced that he had sold the pile of timber to frederick. tomorrow frederick's wagons would arrive and begin carting it away. throughout the whole period of his seeming friendship with pilkington, napoleon had really been in secret agreement with frederick. all relations with foxwood had been broken off; insulting messages had been sent to pilkington. the pigeons had been told to avoid pinchfield farm and to alter their slogan from \"death to frederick\" to \"death to pilkington.\" at the same time napoleon assured the animals that the stories of an impending attack on animal farm were completely untrue, and that the tales about frederick's cruelty to his own animals had been greatly exaggerated. all these rumours had probably originated with snowball and his agents. it now appeared that snowball was not, after all, hiding on pinchfield farm, and in fact had never been there in his life: he was living--in considerable luxury, so it was said--at foxwood, and had in reality been a pensioner of pilkington for years past. the pigs were in ecstasies over napoleon's cunning. by seeming to be friendly with pilkington he had forced frederick to raise his price by twelve pounds. but the superior quality of napoleon's mind, said squealer, was shown in the fact that he trusted nobody, not even frederick. frederick had wanted to pay for the timber with something called a cheque, which, it seemed, was a piece of paper with a promise to pay written upon it. but napoleon was too clever for him. he had demanded payment in real five-pound notes, which were to be handed over before the timber was removed. already frederick had paid up; and the sum he had paid was just enough to buy the machinery for the windmill. meanwhile the timber was being carted away at high speed. when it was all gone, another special meeting was held in the barn for the animals to inspect frederick's bank-notes. smiling beatifically, and wearing both his decorations, napoleon reposed on a bed of straw on the platform, with the money at his side, neatly piled on a china dish from the farmhouse kitchen. the animals filed slowly past, and each gazed his fill. and boxer put out his nose to sniff at the bank-notes, and the flimsy white things stirred and rustled in his breath. three days later there was a terrible hullabaloo. whymper, his face deadly pale, came racing up the path on his bicycle, flung it down in the yard and rushed straight into the farmhouse. the next moment a choking roar of rage sounded from napoleon's apartments. the news of what had happened sped round the farm like wildfire. the banknotes were forgeries! frederick had got the timber for nothing! napoleon called the animals together immediately and in a terrible voice pronounced the death sentence upon frederick. when captured, he said, frederick should be boiled alive. at the same time he warned them that after this treacherous deed the worst was to be expected. frederick and his men might make their long-expected attack at any moment. sentinels were placed at all the approaches to the farm. in addition, four pigeons were sent to foxwood with a conciliatory message, which it was hoped might re-establish good relations with pilkington. the very next morning the attack came. the animals were at breakfast when the look-outs came racing in with the news that frederick and his followers had already come through the five-barred gate. boldly enough the animals sallied forth to meet them, but this time they did not have the easy victory that they had had in the battle of the cowshed. there were fifteen men, with half a dozen guns between them, and they opened fire as soon as they got within fifty yards. the animals could not face the terrible explosions and the stinging pellets, and in spite of the efforts of napoleon and boxer to rally them, they were soon driven back. a number of them were already wounded. they took refuge in the farm buildings and peeped cautiously out from chinks and knot-holes. the whole of the big pasture, including the windmill, was in the hands of the enemy. for the moment even napoleon seemed at a loss. he paced up and down without a word, his tail rigid and twitching. wistful glances were sent in the direction of foxwood. if pilkington and his men would help them, the day might yet be won. but at this moment the four pigeons, who had been sent out on the day before, returned, one of them bearing a scrap of paper from pilkington. on it was pencilled the words: \"serves you right.\" meanwhile frederick and his men had halted about the windmill. the animals watched them, and a murmur of dismay went round. two of the men had produced a crowbar and a sledge hammer. they were going to knock the windmill down. \"impossible!\" cried napoleon. \"we have built the walls far too thick for that. they could not knock it down in a week. courage, comrades!\" but benjamin was watching the movements of the men intently. the two with the hammer and the crowbar were drilling a hole near the base of the windmill. slowly, and with an air almost of amusement, benjamin nodded his long muzzle. \"i thought so,\" he said. \"do you not see what they are doing? in another moment they are going to pack blasting powder into that hole.\" terrified, the animals waited. it was impossible now to venture out of the shelter of the buildings. after a few minutes the men were seen to be running in all directions. then there was a deafening roar. the pigeons swirled into the air, and all the animals, except napoleon, flung themselves flat on their bellies and hid their faces. when they got up again, a huge cloud of black smoke was hanging where the windmill had been. slowly the breeze drifted it away. the windmill had ceased to exist! at this sight the animals' courage returned to them. the fear and despair they had felt a moment earlier were drowned in their rage against this vile, contemptible act. a mighty cry for vengeance went up, and without waiting for further orders they charged forth in a body and made straight for the enemy. this time they did not heed the cruel pellets that swept over them like hail. it was a savage, bitter battle. the men fired again and again, and, when the animals got to close quarters, lashed out with their sticks and their heavy boots. a cow, three sheep, and two geese were killed, and nearly everyone was wounded. even napoleon, who was directing operations from the rear, had the tip of his tail chipped by a pellet. but the men did not go unscathed either. three of them had their heads broken by blows from boxer's hoofs; another was gored in the belly by a cow's horn; another had his trousers nearly torn off by jessie and bluebell. and when the nine dogs of napoleon's own bodyguard, whom he had instructed to make a detour under cover of the hedge, suddenly appeared on the men's flank, baying ferociously, panic overtook them. they saw that they were in danger of being surrounded. frederick shouted to his men to get out while the going was good, and the next moment the cowardly enemy was running for dear life. the animals chased them right down to the bottom of the field, and got in some last kicks at them as they forced their way through the thorn hedge. they had won, but they were weary and bleeding. slowly they began to limp back towards the farm. the sight of their dead comrades stretched upon the grass moved some of them to tears. and for a little while they halted in sorrowful silence at the place where the windmill had once stood. yes, it was gone; almost the last trace of their labour was gone! even the foundations were partially destroyed. and in rebuilding it they could not this time, as before, make use of the fallen stones. this time the stones had vanished too. the force of the explosion had flung them to distances of hundreds of yards. it was as though the windmill had never been. as they approached the farm squealer, who had unaccountably been absent during the fighting, came skipping towards them, whisking his tail and beaming with satisfaction. and the animals heard, from the direction of the farm buildings, the solemn booming of a gun. \"what is that gun firing for?\" said boxer. \"to celebrate our victory!\" cried squealer. \"what victory?\" said boxer. his knees were bleeding, he had lost a shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in his hind leg. \"what victory, comrade? have we not driven the enemy off our soil--the sacred soil of animal farm?\" \"but they have destroyed the windmill. and we had worked on it for two years!\" \"what matter? we will build another windmill. we will build six windmills if we feel like it. you do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty thing that we have done. the enemy was in occupation of this very ground that we stand upon. and now--thanks to the leadership of comrade napoleon--we have won every inch of it back again!\" \"then we have won back what we had before,\" said boxer. \"that is our victory,\" said squealer. they limped into the yard. the pellets under the skin of boxer's leg smarted painfully. he saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced himself for the task. but for the first time it occurred to him that he was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite what they had once been. but when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun firing again--seven times it was fired in all--and heard the speech that napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them after all that they had won a great victory. the animals slain in the battle were given a solemn funeral. boxer and clover pulled the wagon which served as a hearse, and napoleon himself walked at the head of the procession. two whole days were given over to celebrations. there were songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each bird and three biscuits for each dog. it was announced that the battle would be called the battle of the windmill, and that napoleon had created a new decoration, the order of the green banner, which he had conferred upon himself. in the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair of the banknotes was forgotten. it was a few days later than this that the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. it had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied. that night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which, to everyone's surprise, the strains of 'beasts of england' were mixed up. at about half past nine napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of mr. jones's, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again. but in the morning a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. not a pig appeared to be stirring. it was nearly nine o'clock when squealer made his appearance, walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill. he called the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news to impart. comrade napoleon was dying! a cry of lamentation went up. straw was laid down outside the doors of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. with tears in their eyes they asked one another what they should do if their leader were taken away from them. a rumour went round that snowball had after all contrived to introduce poison into napoleon's food. at eleven o'clock squealer came out to make another announcement. as his last act upon earth, comrade napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of alcohol was to be punished by death. by the evening, however, napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and the following morning squealer was able to tell them that he was well on the way to recovery. by the evening of that day napoleon was back at work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed whymper to purchase in willingdon some booklets on brewing and distilling. a week later napoleon gave orders that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously been intended to set aside as a grazing-ground for animals who were past work, was to be ploughed up. it was given out that the pasture was exhausted and needed re-seeding; but it soon became known that napoleon intended to sow it with barley. about this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone was able to understand. one night at about twelve o'clock there was a loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. it was a moonlit night. at the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where the seven commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two pieces. squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near at hand there lay a lantern, a paint-brush, and an overturned pot of white paint. the dogs immediately made a ring round squealer, and escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. none of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to understand, but would say nothing. but a few days later muriel, reading over the seven commandments to herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals had remembered wrong. they had thought the fifth commandment was \"no animal shall drink alcohol,\" but there were two words that they had forgotten. actually the commandment read: \"no animal shall drink alcohol to excess.\" chapter ix boxer's split hoof was a long time in healing. they had started the rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were ended. boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. in the evenings he would admit privately to clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal. clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by chewing them, and both she and benjamin urged boxer to work less hard. \"a horse's lungs do not last for ever,\" she said to him. but boxer would not listen. he had, he said, only one real ambition left--to see the windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement. at the beginning, when the laws of animal farm were first formulated, the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and geese at five. liberal old-age pensions had been agreed upon. as yet no animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been discussed more and more. now that the small field beyond the orchard had been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing-ground for superannuated animals. for a horse, it was said, the pension would be five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. boxer's twelfth birthday was due in the late summer of the following year. meanwhile life was hard. the winter was as cold as the last one had been, and food was even shorter. once again all rations were reduced, except those of the pigs and the dogs. a too rigid equality in rations, squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of animalism. in any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the appearances might be. for the time being, certainly, it had been found necessary to make a readjustment of rations (squealer always spoke of it as a \"readjustment,\" never as a \"reduction\"), but in comparison with the days of jones, the improvement was enormous. reading out the figures in a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in jones's day, that they worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality, that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and suffered less from fleas. the animals believed every word of it. truth to tell, jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their memories. they knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they were often hungry and often cold, and that they were usually working when they were not asleep. but doubtless it had been worse in the old days. they were glad to believe so. besides, in those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made all the difference, as squealer did not fail to point out. there were many more mouths to feed now. in the autumn the four sows had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty-one young pigs between them. the young pigs were piebald, and as napoleon was the only boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. it was announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. for the time being, the young pigs were given their instruction by napoleon himself in the farmhouse kitchen. they took their exercise in the garden, and were discouraged from playing with the other young animals. about this time, too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs, of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons on their tails on sundays. the farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of money. there were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for the machinery for the windmill. then there were lamp oil and candles for the house, sugar for napoleon's own table (he forbade this to the other pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap-iron, and dog biscuits. a stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off, and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at the same level. rations, reduced in december, were reduced again in february, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save oil. but the pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if anything. one afternoon in late february a warm, rich, appetising scent, such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the yard from the little brew-house, which had been disused in jones's time, and which stood beyond the kitchen. someone said it was the smell of cooking barley. the animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. but no warm mash appeared, and on the following sunday it was announced that from now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. the field beyond the orchard had already been sown with barley. and the news soon leaked out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily, with half a gallon for napoleon himself, which was always served to him in the crown derby soup tureen. but if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had before. there were more songs, more speeches, more processions. napoleon had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a spontaneous demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the struggles and triumphs of animal farm. at the appointed time the animals would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. the dogs flanked the procession and at the head of all marched napoleon's black cockerel. boxer and clover always carried between them a green banner marked with the hoof and the horn and the caption, \"long live comrade napoleon!\" afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in napoleon's honour, and a speech by squealer giving particulars of the latest increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was fired from the gun. the sheep were the greatest devotees of the spontaneous demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to silence him with a tremendous bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad!\" but by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. they found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit. so that, what with the songs, the processions, squealer's lists of figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were empty, at least part of the time. in april, animal farm was proclaimed a republic, and it became necessary to elect a president. there was only one candidate, napoleon, who was elected unanimously. on the same day it was given out that fresh documents had been discovered which revealed further details about snowball's complicity with jones. it now appeared that snowball had not, as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the battle of the cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly fighting on jones's side. in fact, it was he who had actually been the leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words \"long live humanity!\" on his lips. the wounds on snowball's back, which a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted by napoleon's teeth. in the middle of the summer moses the raven suddenly reappeared on the farm, after an absence of several years. he was quite unchanged, still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about sugarcandy mountain. he would perch on a stump, flap his black wings, and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen. \"up there, comrades,\" he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with his large beak--\"up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that you can see--there it lies, sugarcandy mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!\" he even claimed to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing on the hedges. many of the animals believed him. their lives now, they reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a better world should exist somewhere else? a thing that was difficult to determine was the attitude of the pigs towards moses. they all declared contemptuously that his stories about sugarcandy mountain were lies, and yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an allowance of a gill of beer a day. after his hoof had healed up, boxer worked harder than ever. indeed, all the animals worked like slaves that year. apart from the regular work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in march. sometimes the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but boxer never faltered. in nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his strength was not what it had been. it was only his appearance that was a little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his great haunches seemed to have shrunken. the others said, \"boxer will pick up when the spring grass comes on\"; but the spring came and boxer grew no fatter. sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry, when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. at such times his lips were seen to form the words, \"i will work harder\"; he had no voice left. once again clover and benjamin warned him to take care of his health, but boxer paid no attention. his twelfth birthday was approaching. he did not care what happened so long as a good store of stone was accumulated before he went on pension. late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm that something had happened to boxer. he had gone out alone to drag a load of stone down to the windmill. and sure enough, the rumour was true. a few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news; \"boxer has fallen! he is lying on his side and can't get up!\" about half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the windmill stood. there lay boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. his eyes were glazed, his sides matted with sweat. a thin stream of blood had trickled out of his mouth. clover dropped to her knees at his side. \"boxer!\" she cried, \"how are you?\" \"it is my lung,\" said boxer in a weak voice. \"it does not matter. i think you will be able to finish the windmill without me. there is a pretty good store of stone accumulated. i had only another month to go in any case. to tell you the truth, i had been looking forward to my retirement. and perhaps, as benjamin is growing old too, they will let him retire at the same time and be a companion to me.\" \"we must get help at once,\" said clover. \"run, somebody, and tell squealer what has happened.\" all the other animals immediately raced back to the farmhouse to give squealer the news. only clover remained, and benjamin who lay down at boxer's side, and, without speaking, kept the flies off him with his long tail. after about a quarter of an hour squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern. he said that comrade napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making arrangements to send boxer to be treated in the hospital at willingdon. the animals felt a little uneasy at this. except for mollie and snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. however, squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in willingdon could treat boxer's case more satisfactorily than could be done on the farm. and about half an hour later, when boxer had somewhat recovered, he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to his stall, where clover and benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw for him. for the next two days boxer remained in his stall. the pigs had sent out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine chest in the bathroom, and clover administered it to boxer twice a day after meals. in the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him, while benjamin kept the flies off him. boxer professed not to be sorry for what had happened. if he made a good recovery, he might expect to live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. it would be the first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. he intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the remaining twenty-two letters of the alphabet. however, benjamin and clover could only be with boxer after working hours, and it was in the middle of the day when the van came to take him away. the animals were all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they were astonished to see benjamin come galloping from the direction of the farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. it was the first time that they had ever seen benjamin excited--indeed, it was the first time that anyone had ever seen him gallop. \"quick, quick!\" he shouted. \"come at once! they're taking boxer away!\" without waiting for orders from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm buildings. sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly-looking man in a low-crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver's seat. and boxer's stall was empty. the animals crowded round the van. \"good-bye, boxer!\" they chorused, \"good-bye!\" \"fools! fools!\" shouted benjamin, prancing round them and stamping the earth with his small hoofs. \"fools! do you not see what is written on the side of that van?\" that gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. muriel began to spell out the words. but benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a deadly silence he read: \"'alfred simmonds, horse slaughterer and glue boiler, willingdon. dealer in hides and bone-meal. kennels supplied.' do you not understand what that means? they are taking boxer to the knacker's!\" a cry of horror burst from all the animals. at this moment the man on the box whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot. all the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. clover forced her way to the front. the van began to gather speed. clover tried to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. \"boxer!\" she cried. \"boxer! boxer! boxer!\" and just at this moment, as though he had heard the uproar outside, boxer's face, with the white stripe down his nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van. \"boxer!\" cried clover in a terrible voice. \"boxer! get out! get out quickly! they're taking you to your death!\" all the animals took up the cry of \"get out, boxer, get out!\" but the van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. it was uncertain whether boxer had understood what clover had said. but a moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. he was trying to kick his way out. the time had been when a few kicks from boxer's hoofs would have smashed the van to matchwood. but alas! his strength had left him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and died away. in desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses which drew the van to stop. \"comrades, comrades!\" they shouted. \"don't take your own brother to his death!\" but the stupid brutes, too ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their ears and quickened their pace. boxer's face did not reappear at the window. too late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five-barred gate; but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing down the road. boxer was never seen again. three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have. squealer came to announce the news to the others. he had, he said, been present during boxer's last hours. \"it was the most affecting sight i have ever seen!\" said squealer, lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear. \"i was at his bedside at the very last. and at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was finished. 'forward, comrades!' he whispered. 'forward in the name of the rebellion. long live animal farm! long live comrade napoleon! napoleon is always right.' those were his very last words, comrades.\" here squealer's demeanour suddenly changed. he fell silent for a moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side before he proceeded. it had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked rumour had been circulated at the time of boxer's removal. some of the animals had noticed that the van which took boxer away was marked \"horse slaughterer,\" and had actually jumped to the conclusion that boxer was being sent to the knacker's. it was almost unbelievable, said squealer, that any animal could be so stupid. surely, he cried indignantly, whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their beloved leader, comrade napoleon, better than that? but the explanation was really very simple. the van had previously been the property of the knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet painted the old name out. that was how the mistake had arisen. the animals were enormously relieved to hear this. and when squealer went on to give further graphic details of boxer's death-bed, the admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade's death was tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy. napoleon himself appeared at the meeting on the following sunday morning and pronounced a short oration in boxer's honour. it had not been possible, he said, to bring back their lamented comrade's remains for interment on the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on boxer's grave. and in a few days' time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in boxer's honour. napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of boxer's two favourite maxims, \"i will work harder\" and \"comrade napoleon is always right\"--maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his own. on the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer's van drove up from willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. that night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o'clock with a tremendous crash of glass. no one stirred in the farmhouse before noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case of whisky. chapter x years passed. the seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled by. a time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before the rebellion, except clover, benjamin, moses the raven, and a number of the pigs. muriel was dead; bluebell, jessie, and pincher were dead. jones too was dead--he had died in an inebriates' home in another part of the country. snowball was forgotten. boxer was forgotten, except by the few who had known him. clover was an old stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes. she was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever actually retired. the talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for superannuated animals had long since been dropped. napoleon was now a mature boar of twenty-four stone. squealer was so fat that he could with difficulty see out of his eyes. only old benjamin was much the same as ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since boxer's death, more morose and taciturn than ever. there were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. many animals had been born to whom the rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of such a thing before their arrival. the farm possessed three horses now besides clover. they were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and good comrades, but very stupid. none of them proved able to learn the alphabet beyond the letter b. they accepted everything that they were told about the rebellion and the principles of animalism, especially from clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was doubtful whether they understood very much of it. the farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from mr. pilkington. the windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various new buildings had been added to it. whymper had bought himself a dogcart. the windmill, however, had not after all been used for generating electrical power. it was used for milling corn, and brought in a handsome money profit. the animals were hard at work building yet another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the dynamos would be installed. but the luxuries of which snowball had once taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and cold water, and the three-day week, were no longer talked about. napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of animalism. the truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living frugally. somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making the animals themselves any richer-except, of course, for the pigs and the dogs. perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so many dogs. it was not that these creatures did not work, after their fashion. there was, as squealer was never tired of explaining, endless work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. much of this work was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand. for example, squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous labours every day upon mysterious things called \"files,\" \"reports,\" \"minutes,\" and \"memoranda\". these were large sheets of paper which had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so covered, they were burnt in the furnace. this was of the highest importance for the welfare of the farm, squealer said. but still, neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour; and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always good. as for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had always been. they were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled by the cold, and in summer by the flies. sometimes the older ones among them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the early days of the rebellion, when jones's expulsion was still recent, things had been better or worse than now. they could not remember. there was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had nothing to go upon except squealer's lists of figures, which invariably demonstrated that everything was getting better and better. the animals found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for speculating on such things now. only old benjamin professed to remember every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been, nor ever could be much better or much worse--hunger, hardship, and disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life. and yet the animals never gave up hope. more, they never lost, even for an instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of animal farm. they were still the only farm in the whole county--in all england!--owned and operated by animals. not one of them, not even the youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. and when they heard the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of jones, the writing of the seven commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had been defeated. none of the old dreams had been abandoned. the republic of the animals which major had foretold, when the green fields of england should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. some day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with in the lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. even the tune of 'beasts of england' was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no one would have dared to sing it aloud. it might be that their lives were hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were conscious that they were not as other animals. if they went hungry, it was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at least they worked for themselves. no creature among them went upon two legs. no creature called any other creature \"master.\" all animals were equal. one day in early summer squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm, which had become overgrown with birch saplings. the sheep spent the whole day there browsing at the leaves under squealer's supervision. in the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. it ended by their remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals saw nothing of them. squealer was with them for the greater part of every day. he was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which privacy was needed. it was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard. startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. it was clover's voice. she neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed into the yard. then they saw what clover had seen. it was a pig walking on his hind legs. yes, it was squealer. a little awkwardly, as though not quite used to supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect balance, he was strolling across the yard. and a moment later, out from the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their hind legs. some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard successfully. and finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came napoleon himself, majestically upright, casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs gambolling round him. he carried a whip in his trotter. there was a deadly silence. amazed, terrified, huddling together, the animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. it was as though the world had turned upside-down. then there came a moment when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything-in spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what happened--they might have uttered some word of protest. but just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of-- \"four legs good, two legs better! four legs good, two legs better! four legs good, two legs better!\" it went on for five minutes without stopping. and by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse. benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. he looked round. it was clover. her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. without saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the end of the big barn, where the seven commandments were written. for a minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white lettering. \"my sight is failing,\" she said finally. \"even when i was young i could not have read what was written there. but it appears to me that that wall looks different. are the seven commandments the same as they used to be, benjamin?\" for once benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her what was written on the wall. there was nothing there now except a single commandment. it ran: all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others after that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. it did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out subscriptions to 'john bull', 'tit-bits', and the 'daily mirror'. it did not seem strange when napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden with a pipe in his mouth--no, not even when the pigs took mr. jones's clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, napoleon himself appearing in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which mrs. jones had been used to wearing on sundays. a week later, in the afternoon, a number of dog-carts drove up to the farm. a deputation of neighbouring farmers had been invited to make a tour of inspection. they were shown all over the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw, especially the windmill. the animals were weeding the turnip field. they worked diligently hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human visitors. that evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the farmhouse. and suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals were stricken with curiosity. what could be happening in there, now that for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of equality? with one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible into the farmhouse garden. at the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but clover led the way in. they tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall enough peered in at the dining-room window. there, round the long table, sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs, napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table. the pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs. the company had been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment, evidently in order to drink a toast. a large jug was circulating, and the mugs were being refilled with beer. no one noticed the wondering faces of the animals that gazed in at the window. mr. pilkington, of foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. in a moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. but before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon him to say. it was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said--and, he was sure, to all others present--to feel that a long period of mistrust and misunderstanding had now come to an end. there had been a time--not that he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments--but there had been a time when the respected proprietors of animal farm had been regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. unfortunate incidents had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. it had been felt that the existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. too many farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit of licence and indiscipline would prevail. they had been nervous about the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees. but all such doubts were now dispelled. today he and his friends had visited animal farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes, and what did they find? not only the most up-to-date methods, but a discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers everywhere. he believed that he was right in saying that the lower animals on animal farm did more work and received less food than any animals in the county. indeed, he and his fellow-visitors today had observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own farms immediately. he would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between animal farm and its neighbours. between pigs and human beings there was not, and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. their struggles and their difficulties were one. was not the labour problem the same everywhere? here it became apparent that mr. pilkington was about to spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. after much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed to get it out: \"if you have your lower animals to contend with,\" he said, \"we have our lower classes!\" this bon mot set the table in a roar; and mr. pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had observed on animal farm. and now, he said finally, he would ask the company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were full. \"gentlemen,\" concluded mr. pilkington, \"gentlemen, i give you a toast: to the prosperity of animal farm!\" there was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. napoleon was so gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his mug against mr. pilkington's before emptying it. when the cheering had died down, napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too had a few words to say. like all of napoleon's speeches, it was short and to the point. he too, he said, was happy that the period of misunderstanding was at an end. for a long time there had been rumours--circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy--that there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of himself and his colleagues. they had been credited with attempting to stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. nothing could be further from the truth! their sole wish, now and in the past, was to live at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. this farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co-operative enterprise. the title-deeds, which were in his own possession, were owned by the pigs jointly. he did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence still further. hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish custom of addressing one another as \"comrade.\" this was to be suppressed. there had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was unknown, of marching every sunday morning past a boar's skull which was nailed to a post in the garden. this, too, would be suppressed, and the skull had already been buried. his visitors might have observed, too, the green flag which flew from the masthead. if so, they would perhaps have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously been marked had now been removed. it would be a plain green flag from now onwards. he had only one criticism, he said, to make of mr. pilkington's excellent and neighbourly speech. mr. pilkington had referred throughout to \"animal farm.\" he could not of course know--for he, napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it--that the name \"animal farm\" had been abolished. henceforward the farm was to be known as \"the manor farm\"--which, he believed, was its correct and original name. \"gentlemen,\" concluded napoleon, \"i will give you the same toast as before, but in a different form. fill your glasses to the brim. gentlemen, here is my toast: to the prosperity of the manor farm!\" there was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied to the dregs. but as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed to them that some strange thing was happening. what was it that had altered in the faces of the pigs? clover's old dim eyes flitted from one face to another. some of them had five chins, some had four, some had three. but what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? then, the applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept silently away. but they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. an uproar of voices was coming from the farmhouse. they rushed back and looked through the window again. yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. there were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. the source of the trouble appeared to be that napoleon and mr. pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously. twelve voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. no question, now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. the creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which."

      " chapter one a squat grey building of only thirty-four stories. over the main en- trance the words, central london hatchery and conditioning centre, and, in a shield, the world state's motto, community, iden- tity, stability. the enormous room on the ground floor faced towards the north. cold for all the summer beyond the panes, for all the tropical heat of the room itself, a harsh thin light glared through the windows, hungrily seeking some draped lay figure, some pallid shape of academic goose- flesh, but finding only the glass and nickel and bleakly shining porce- lain of a laboratory. wintriness responded to wintriness. the overalls of the workers were white, their hands gloved with a pale corpse- coloured rubber. the light was frozen, dead, a ghost. only from the yellow barrels of the microscopes did it borrow a certain rich and living substance, lying along the polished tubes like butter, streak after luscious streak in long recession down the work tables. \"and this,\" said the director opening the door, \"is the fertilizing room.\" bent over their instruments, three hundred fertilizers were plunged, as the director of hatcheries and conditioning entered the room, in the scarcely breathing silence, the absent-minded, soliloquizing hum or whistle, of absorbed concentration. a troop of newly arrived students, very young, pink and callow, followed nervously, rather abjectly, at the director's heels. each of them carried a notebook, in which, whenever the great man spoke, he desperately scribbled. straight from the horse's mouth. it was a rare privilege. the d. h. c. for central london always made a point of personally conducting his new students round the various departments. \"just to give you a general idea,\" he would explain to them. for of course some sort of general idea they must have, if they were to do their work intelligently-though as little of one, if they were to be good and happy members of society, as possible. for particulars, as every one knows, make for virtue and happiness; generalities are intellectu- ally necessary evils. not philosophers but fret-sawyers and stamp col- lectors compose the backbone of society. \"to-morrow,\" he would add, smiling at them with a slightly menacing geniality, \"you'll be settling down to serious work. you won't have time for generalities. meanwhile ...\" meanwhile, it was a privilege. straight from the horse's mouth into the notebook. the boys scribbled like mad. tall and rather thin but upright, the director advanced into the room. he had a long chin and big rather prominent teeth, just covered, when he was not talking, by his full, floridly curved lips. old, young? thirty? fifty? fifty-five? it was hard to say. and anyhow the question didn't arise; in this year of stability, a. f. 632, it didn't occur to you to ask it. \"i shall begin at the beginning,\" said the d.h.c. and the more zealous students recorded his intention in their notebooks: begin at the begin- ning. \"these,\" he waved his hand, \"are the incubators.\" and opening an insulated door he showed them racks upon racks of numbered test- tubes. \"the week's supply of ova. kept,\" he explained, \"at blood heat; whereas the male gametes,\" and here he opened another door, \"they have to be kept at thirty-five instead of thirty-seven. full blood heat sterilizes.\" rams wrapped in theremogene beget no lambs. still leaning against the incubators he gave them, while the pencils scurried illegibly across the pages, a brief description of the modern fertilizing process; spoke first, of course, of its surgical introduc- tion-\"the operation undergone voluntarily for the good of society, not to mention the fact that it carries a bonus amounting to six months' salary\"; continued with some account of the technique for preserving the excised ovary alive and actively developing; passed on to a consid- eration of optimum temperature, salinity, viscosity; referred to the liq- uor in which the detached and ripened eggs were kept; and, leading his charges to the work tables, actually showed them how this liquor was drawn off from the test-tubes; how it was let out drop by drop onto the specially warmed slides of the microscopes; how the eggs which it contained were inspected for abnormalities, counted and transferred to a porous receptacle; how (and he now took them to watch the operation) this receptacle was immersed in a warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa-at a minimum concentration of one hundred thousand per cubic centimetre, he insisted; and how, after ten minutes, the container was lifted out of the liquor and its contents re-examined; how, if any of the eggs remained unfertilized, it was again immersed, and, if necessary, yet again; how the fertilized ova went back to the incubators; where the alphas and betas re- mained until definitely bottled; while the gammas, deltas and epsilons were brought out again, after only thirty-six hours, to undergo bo- kanovsky's process. \"bokanovsky's process,\" repeated the director, and the students un- derlined the words in their little notebooks. one egg, one embryo, one adult-normality. but a bokanovskified egg will bud, will proliferate, will divide. from eight to ninety-six buds, and every bud will grow into a perfectly formed embryo, and every embryo into a full-sized adult. making ninety-six human beings grow where only one grew before. progress. \"essentially,\" the d.h.c. concluded, \"bokanovskification consists of a series of arrests of development. we check the normal growth and, paradoxically enough, the egg responds by budding.\" responds by budding. the pencils were busy. he pointed. on a very slowly moving band a rack-full of test-tubes was entering a large metal box, another, rack-full was emerging. machinery faintly purred. it took eight minutes for the tubes to go through, he told them. eight minutes of hard x-rays being about as much as an egg can stand. a few died; of the rest, the least susceptible divided into two; most put out four buds; some eight; all were returned to the incubators, where the buds began to develop; then, after two days, were suddenly chilled, chilled and checked. two, four, eight, the buds in their turn budded; and having budded were dosed almost to death with alcohol; consequently burgeoned again and having budded-bud out of bud out of bud-were thereafter-further arrest being generally fatal-left to develop in peace. by which time the original egg was in a fair way to becoming anything from eight to ninety-six embryos- a prodigious improvement, you will agree, on nature. identical twins-but not in piddling twos and threes as in the old viviparous days, when an egg would sometimes accidentally divide; actually by dozens, by scores at a time. \"scores,\" the director repeated and flung out his arms, as though he were distributing largesse. \"scores.\" but one of the students was fool enough to ask where the advantage lay. \"my good boy!\" the director wheeled sharply round on him. \"can't you see? can't you see?\" he raised a hand; his expression was solemn. \"bokanovsky's process is one of the major instruments of social stabil- ity!\" major instruments of social stability. standard men and women; in uniform batches. the whole of a small factory staffed with the products of a single bokanovskified egg. \"ninety-six identical twins working ninety-six identical machines!\" the voice was almost tremulous with enthusiasm. \"you really know where you are. for the first time in history.\" he quoted the planetary motto. \"community, identity, stability.\" grand words. \"if we could bo- kanovskify indefinitely the whole problem would be solved.\" solved by standard gammas, unvarying deltas, uniform epsilons. mil- lions of identical twins. the principle of mass production at last applied to biology. \"but, alas,\" the director shook his head, \"we can't bokanovskify indefi- nitely.\" ninety-six seemed to be the limit; seventy-two a good average. from the same ovary and with gametes of the same male to manufacture as many batches of identical twins as possible-that was the best (sadly a second best) that they could do. and even that was difficult. \"for in nature it takes thirty years for two hundred eggs to reach ma- turity. but our business is to stabilize the population at this moment, here and now. dribbling out twins over a quarter of a century-what would be the use of that?\" obviously, no use at all. but podsnap's technique had immensely ac- celerated the process of ripening. they could make sure of at least a hundred and fifty mature eggs within two years. fertilize and bo- kanovskify-in other words, multiply by seventy-two-and you get an average of nearly eleven thousand brothers and sisters in a hundred and fifty batches of identical twins, all within two years of the same age. \"and in exceptional cases we can make one ovary yield us over fifteen thousand adult individuals.\" beckoning to a fair-haired, ruddy young man who happened to be passing at the moment. \"mr. foster,\" he called. the ruddy young man approached. \"can you tell us the record for a single ovary, mr. foster?\" \"sixteen thousand and twelve in this centre,\" mr. foster replied with- out hesitation. he spoke very quickly, had a vivacious blue eye, and took an evident pleasure in quoting figures. \"sixteen thousand and twelve; in one hundred and eighty-nine batches of identicals. but of course they've done much better,\" he rattled on, \"in some of the tropi- cal centres. singapore has often produced over sixteen thousand five hundred; and mombasa has actually touched the seventeen thousand mark. but then they have unfair advantages. you should see the way a negro ovary responds to pituitary! it's quite astonishing, when you're used to working with european material. still,\" he added, with a laugh (but the light of combat was in his eyes and the lift of his chin was challenging), \"still, we mean to beat them if we can. i'm working on a wonderful delta-minus ovary at this moment. only just eighteen months old. over twelve thousand seven hundred children already, ei- ther decanted or in embryo. and still going strong. we'll beat them yet.\" \"that's the spirit i like!\" cried the director, and clapped mr. foster on the shoulder. \"come along with us, and give these boys the benefit of your expert knowledge.\" mr. foster smiled modestly. \"with pleasure.\" they went. in the bottling room all was harmonious bustle and ordered activity. flaps of fresh sow's peritoneum ready cut to the proper size came shooting up in little lifts from the organ store in the sub-basement. whizz and then, click! the lift-hatches hew open; the bottle-liner had only to reach out a hand, take the flap, insert, smooth-down, and be- fore the lined bottle had had time to travel out of reach along the end- less band, whizz, click! another flap of peritoneum had shot up from the depths, ready to be slipped into yet another bottle, the next of that slow interminable procession on the band. next to the liners stood the matriculators. the procession advanced; one by one the eggs were transferred from their test-tubes to the larger containers; deftly the peritoneal lining was slit, the morula dropped into place, the saline solution poured in ... and already the bottle had passed, and it was the turn of the labellers. heredity, date of fertilization, membership of bokanovsky group-details were trans- ferred from test-tube to bottle. no longer anonymous, but named, identified, the procession marched slowly on; on through an opening in the wall, slowly on into the social predestination room. \"eighty-eight cubic metres of card-index,\" said mr. foster with relish, as they entered. \"containing all the relevant information,\" added the director. \"brought up to date every morning.\" \"and co-ordinated every afternoon.\" \"on the basis of which they make their calculations.\" \"so many individuals, of such and such quality,\" said mr. foster. \"distributed in such and such quantities.\" \"the optimum decanting rate at any given moment.\" \"unforeseen wastages promptly made good.\" \"promptly,\" repeated mr. foster. \"if you knew the amount of overtime i had to put in after the last japanese earthquake!\" he laughed good- humouredly and shook his head. \"the predestinators send in their figures to the fertilizers.\" \"who give them the embryos they ask for.\" \"and the bottles come in here to be predestined in detail.\" \"after which they are sent down to the embryo store.\" \"where we now proceed ourselves.\" and opening a door mr. foster led the way down a staircase into the basement. the temperature was still tropical. they descended into a thickening twilight. two doors and a passage with a double turn insured the cellar against any possible infiltration of the day. \"embryos are like photograph film,\" said mr. foster waggishly, as he pushed open the second door. \"they can only stand red light.\" and in effect the sultry darkness into which the students now followed him was visible and crimson, like the darkness of closed eyes on a summer's afternoon. the bulging flanks of row on receding row and tier above tier of bottles glinted with innumerable rubies, and among the rubies moved the dim red spectres of men and women with purple eyes and all the symptoms of lupus. the hum and rattle of machinery faintly stirred the air. \"give them a few figures, mr. foster,\" said the director, who was tired of talking. mr. foster was only too happy to give them a few figures. two hundred and twenty metres long, two hundred wide, ten high. he pointed upwards. like chickens drinking, the students lifted their eyes towards the distant ceiling. three tiers of racks: ground floor level, first gallery, second gallery. the spidery steel-work of gallery above gallery faded away in all direc- tions into the dark. near them three red ghosts were busily unloading demijohns from a moving staircase. the escalator from the social predestination room. each bottle could be placed on one of fifteen racks, each rack, though you couldn't see it, was a conveyor traveling at the rate of thirty-three and a third centimetres an hour. two hundred and sixty-seven days at eight metres a day. two thousand one hundred and thirty-six metres in all. one circuit of the cellar at ground level, one on the first gallery, half on the second, and on the two hundred and sixty-seventh morn- ing, daylight in the decanting room. independent existence-so called. \"but in the interval,\" mr. foster concluded, \"we've managed to do a lot to them. oh, a very great deal.\" his laugh was knowing and trium- phant. \"that's the spirit i like,\" said the director once more. \"let's walk around. you tell them everything, mr. foster.\" mr. foster duly told them. told them of the growing embryo on its bed of peritoneum. made them taste the rich blood surrogate on which it fed. explained why it had to be stimulated with placentin and thyroxin. told them of the corpus lu- teum extract. showed them the jets through which at every twelfth metre from zero to 2040 it was automatically injected. spoke of those gradually increasing doses of pituitary administered during the final ninety-six metres of their course. described the artificial maternal cir- culation installed in every bottle at metre 112; showed them the reser- voir of blood-surrogate, the centrifugal pump that kept the liquid mov- ing over the placenta and drove it through the synthetic lung and waste product filter. referred to the embryo's troublesome tendency to anaemia, to the massive doses of hog's stomach extract and foetal foal's liver with which, in consequence, it had to be supplied. showed them the simple mechanism by means of which, during the last two metres out of every eight, all the embryos were simultane- ously shaken into familiarity with movement. hinted at the gravity of the so-called \"trauma of decanting,\" and enumerated the precautions taken to minimize, by a suitable training of the bottled embryo, that dangerous shock. told them of the test for sex carried out in the neighborhood of metre 200. explained the system of labelling-a t for the males, a circle for the females and for those who were destined to become freemartins a question mark, black on a white ground. \"for of course,\" said mr. foster, \"in the vast majority of cases, fertility is merely a nuisance. one fertile ovary in twelve hundred-that would really be quite sufficient for our purposes. but we want to have a good choice. and of course one must always have an enormous margin of safety. so we allow as many as thirty per cent of the female embryos to develop normally. the others get a dose of male sex-hormone every twenty-four metres for the rest of the course. result: they're decanted as freemartins-structurally quite normal (except,\" he had to admit, \"that they do have the slightest tendency to grow beards), but sterile. guaranteed sterile. which brings us at last,\" continued mr. foster, \"out of the realm of mere slavish imitation of nature into the much more in- teresting world of human invention.\" he rubbed his hands. for of course, they didn't content themselves with merely hatching out embryos: any cow could do that. \"we also predestine and condition. we decant our babies as socialized human beings, as alphas or epsilons, as future sewage workers or fu- ture ...\" he was going to say \"future world controllers,\" but correcting himself, said \"future directors of hatcheries,\" instead. the d.h.c. acknowledged the compliment with a smile. they were passing metre 320 on rack 11. a young beta-minus me- chanic was busy with screw-driver and spanner on the blood-surrogate pump of a passing bottle. the hum of the electric motor deepened by fractions of a tone as he turned the nuts. down, down ... a final twist, a glance at the revolution counter, and he was done. he moved two paces down the line and began the same process on the next pump. \"reducing the number of revolutions per minute,\" mr. foster explained. \"the surrogate goes round slower; therefore passes through the lung at longer intervals; therefore gives the embryo less oxygen. nothing like oxygen-shortage for keeping an embryo below par.\" again he rubbed his hands. \"but why do you want to keep the embryo below par?\" asked an in- genuous student. \"ass!\" said the director, breaking a long silence. \"hasn't it occurred to you that an epsilon embryo must have an epsilon environment as well as an epsilon heredity?\" it evidently hadn't occurred to him. he was covered with confusion. \"the lower the caste,\" said mr. foster, \"the shorter the oxygen.\" the first organ affected was the brain. after that the skeleton. at seventy per cent of normal oxygen you got dwarfs. at less than seventy eye- less monsters. \"who are no use at all,\" concluded mr. foster. whereas (his voice became confidential and eager), if they could dis- cover a technique for shortening the period of maturation what a tri- umph, what a benefaction to society! \"consider the horse.\" they considered it. mature at six; the elephant at ten. while at thirteen a man is not yet sexually mature; and is only full-grown at twenty. hence, of course, that fruit of delayed development, the human intelligence. \"but in epsilons,\" said mr. foster very justly, \"we don't need human in- telligence.\" didn't need and didn't get it. but though the epsilon mind was mature at ten, the epsilon body was not fit to work till eighteen. long years of superfluous and wasted immaturity. if the physical development could be speeded up till it was as quick, say, as a cow's, what an enormous saving to the community! \"enormous!\" murmured the students. mr. foster's enthusiasm was in- fectious. he became rather technical; spoke of the abnormal endocrine co- ordination which made men grow so slowly; postulated a germinal mu- tation to account for it. could the effects of this germinal mutation be undone? could the individual epsilon embryo be made a revert, by a suitable technique, to the normality of dogs and cows? that was the problem. and it was all but solved. pilkington, at mombasa, had produced individuals who were sexually mature at four and full-grown at six and a half. a scientific triumph. but socially useless. six-year-old men and women were too stupid to do even epsilon work. and the process was an all-or-nothing one; ei- ther you failed to modify at all, or else you modified the whole way. they were still trying to find the ideal compromise between adults of twenty and adults of six. so far without success. mr. foster sighed and shook his head. their wanderings through the crimson twilight had brought them to the neighborhood of metre 170 on rack 9. from this point onwards rack 9 was enclosed and the bottle performed the remainder of their journey in a kind of tunnel, interrupted here and there by openings two or three metres wide. \"heat conditioning,\" said mr. foster. hot tunnels alternated with cool tunnels. coolness was wedded to dis- comfort in the form of hard x-rays. by the time they were decanted the embryos had a horror of cold. they were predestined to emigrate to the tropics, to be miner and acetate silk spinners and steel workers. later on their minds would be made to endorse the judgment of their bodies. \"we condition them to thrive on heat,\" concluded mr. foster. \"our colleagues upstairs will teach them to love it.\" \"and that,\" put in the director sententiously, \"that is the secret of hap- piness and virtue-liking what you've got to do. all conditioning aims at that: making people like their unescapable social destiny.\" in a gap between two tunnels, a nurse was delicately probing with a long fine syringe into the gelatinous contents of a passing bottle. the students and their guides stood watching her for a few moments in si- lence. \"well, lenina,\" said mr. foster, when at last she withdrew the syringe and straightened herself up. the girl turned with a start. one could see that, for all the lupus and the purple eyes, she was uncommonly pretty. \"henry!\" her smile flashed redly at him-a row of coral teeth. \"charming, charming,\" murmured the director and, giving her two or three little pats, received in exchange a rather deferential smile for himself. \"what are you giving them?\" asked mr. foster, making his tone very professional. \"oh, the usual typhoid and sleeping sickness.\" \"tropical workers start being inoculated at metre 150,\" mr. foster ex- plained to the students. \"the embryos still have gills. we immunize the fish against the future man's diseases.\" then, turning back to lenina, \"ten to five on the roof this afternoon,\" he said, \"as usual.\" \"charming,\" said the director once more, and, with a final pat, moved away after the others. on rack 10 rows of next generation's chemical workers were being trained in the toleration of lead, caustic soda, tar, chlorine. the first of a batch of two hundred and fifty embryonic rocket-plane engineers was just passing the eleven hundred metre mark on rack 3. a special mechanism kept their containers in constant rotation. \"to improve their sense of balance,\" mr. foster explained. \"doing repairs on the outside of a rocket in mid-air is a ticklish job. we slacken off the circu- lation when they're right way up, so that they're half starved, and double the flow of surrogate when they're upside down. they learn to associate topsy-turvydom with well-being; in fact, they're only truly happy when they're standing on their heads. \"and now,\" mr. foster went on, \"i'd like to show you some very inter- esting conditioning for alpha plus intellectuals. we have a big batch of them on rack 5. first gallery level,\" he called to two boys who had started to go down to the ground floor. \"they're round about metre 900,\" he explained. \"you can't really do any useful intellectual conditioning till the foetuses have lost their tails. follow me.\" but the director had looked at his watch. \"ten to three,\" he said. \"no time for the intellectual embryos, i'm afraid. we must go up to the nurseries before the children have finished their afternoon sleep.\" mr. foster was disappointed. \"at least one glance at the decanting room,\" he pleaded. \"very well then.\" the director smiled indulgently. \"just one glance.\" chapter two mr. foster was left in the decanting room. the d.h.c. and his stu- dents stepped into the nearest lift and were carried up to the fifth floor. infant nurseries. neo-pavlovian conditioning rooms, an- nounced the notice board. the director opened a door. they were in a large bare room, very bright and sunny; for the whole of the southern wall was a single win- dow. half a dozen nurses, trousered and jacketed in the regulation white viscose-linen uniform, their hair aseptically hidden under white caps, were engaged in setting out bowls of roses in a long row across the floor. big bowls, packed tight with blossom. thousands of petals, ripe-blown and silkily smooth, like the cheeks of innumerable little cherubs, but of cherubs, in that bright light, not exclusively pink and aryan, but also luminously chinese, also mexican, also apoplectic with too much blowing of celestial trumpets, also pale as death, pale with the posthumous whiteness of marble. the nurses stiffened to attention as the d.h.c. came in. \"set out the books,\" he said curtly. in silence the nurses obeyed his command. between the rose bowls the books were duly set out-a row of nursery quartos opened invit- ingly each at some gaily coloured image of beast or fish or bird. \"now bring in the children.\" they hurried out of the room and returned in a minute or two, each pushing a kind of tall dumb-waiter laden, on all its four wire-netted shelves, with eight-month-old babies, all exactly alike (a bokanovsky group, it was evident) and all (since their caste was delta) dressed in khaki. \"put them down on the floor.\" the infants were unloaded. \"now turn them so that they can see the flowers and books.\" turned, the babies at once fell silent, then began to crawl towards those clusters of sleek colours, those shapes so gay and brilliant on the white pages. as they approached, the sun came out of a momen- tary eclipse behind a cloud. the roses flamed up as though with a sud- den passion from within; a new and profound significance seemed to suffuse the shining pages of the books. from the ranks of the crawling babies came little squeals of excitement, gurgles and twitterings of pleasure. the director rubbed his hands. \"excellent!\" he said. \"it might almost have been done on purpose.\" the swiftest crawlers were already at their goal. small hands reached out uncertainly, touched, grasped, unpetaling the transfigured roses, crumpling the illuminated pages of the books. the director waited until all were happily busy. then, \"watch carefully,\" he said. and, lifting his hand, he gave the signal. the head nurse, who was standing by a switchboard at the other end of the room, pressed down a little lever. there was a violent explosion. shriller and ever shriller, a siren shrieked. alarm bells maddeningly sounded. the children started, screamed; their faces were distorted with terror. \"and now,\" the director shouted (for the noise was deafening), \"now we proceed to rub in the lesson with a mild electric shock.\" he waved his hand again, and the head nurse pressed a second lever. the screaming of the babies suddenly changed its tone. there was something desperate, almost insane, about the sharp spasmodic yelps to which they now gave utterance. their little bodies twitched and stiffened; their limbs moved jerkily as if to the tug of unseen wires. \"we can electrify that whole strip of floor,\" bawled the director in ex- planation. \"but that's enough,\" he signalled to the nurse. the explosions ceased, the bells stopped ringing, the shriek of the si- ren died down from tone to tone into silence. the stiffly twitching bod- ies relaxed, and what had become the sob and yelp of infant maniacs broadened out once more into a normal howl of ordinary terror. \"offer them the flowers and the books again.\" the nurses obeyed; but at the approach of the roses, at the mere sight of those gaily-coloured images of pussy and cock-a-doodle-doo and baa-baa black sheep, the infants shrank away in horror, the volume of their howling suddenly increased. \"observe,\" said the director triumphantly, \"observe.\" books and loud noises, flowers and electric shocks-already in the in- fant mind these couples were compromisingly linked; and after two hundred repetitions of the same or a similar lesson would be wedded indissolubly. what man has joined, nature is powerless to put asunder. \"they'll grow up with what the psychologists used to call an 'instinc- tive' hatred of books and flowers. reflexes unalterably conditioned. they'll be safe from books and botany all their lives.\" the director turned to his nurses. \"take them away again.\" still yelling, the khaki babies were loaded on to their dumb-waiters and wheeled out, leaving behind them the smell of sour milk and a most welcome silence. one of the students held up his hand; and though he could see quite well why you couldn't have lower-cast people wasting the community's time over books, and that there was always the risk of their reading something which might undesirably decondition one of their reflexes, yet ... well, he couldn't understand about the flowers. why go to the trouble of making it psychologically impossible for deltas to like flow- ers? patiently the d.h.c. explained. if the children were made to scream at the sight of a rose, that was on grounds of high economic policy. not so very long ago (a century or thereabouts), gammas, deltas, even epsilons, had been conditioned to like flowers-flowers in particular and wild nature in general. the idea was to make them want to be going out into the country at every available opportunity, and so compel them to consume transport. \"and didn't they consume transport?\" asked the student. \"quite a lot,\" the d.h.c. replied. \"but nothing else.\" primroses and landscapes, he pointed out, have one grave defect: they are gratuitous. a love of nature keeps no factories busy. it was decided to abolish the love of nature, at any rate among the lower classes; to abolish the love of nature, but not the tendency to consume transport. for of course it was essential that they should keep on going to the country, even though they hated it. the problem was to find an eco- nomically sounder reason for consuming transport than a mere affec- tion for primroses and landscapes. it was duly found. \"we condition the masses to hate the country,\" concluded the director. \"but simultaneously we condition them to love all country sports. at the same time, we see to it that all country sports shall entail the use of elaborate apparatus. so that they consume manufactured articles as well as transport. hence those electric shocks.\" \"i see,\" said the student, and was silent, lost in admiration. there was a silence; then, clearing his throat, \"once upon a time,\" the director began, \"while our ford was still on earth, there was a little boy called reuben rabinovitch. reuben was the child of polish- speaking parents.\" the director interrupted himself. \"you know what polish is, i suppose?\" \"a dead language.\" \"like french and german,\" added another student, officiously showing off his learning. \"and 'parent'?\" questioned the d.h.c. there was an uneasy silence. several of the boys blushed. they had not yet learned to draw the significant but often very fine distinction between smut and pure science. one, at last, had the courage to raise a hand. \"human beings used to be ...\" he hesitated; the blood rushed to his cheeks. \"well, they used to be viviparous.\" \"quite right.\" the director nodded approvingly. \"and when the babies were decanted ...\" '\"born,\"' came the correction. \"well, then they were the parents-i mean, not the babies, of course; the other ones.\" the poor boy was overwhelmed with confusion. \"in brief,\" the director summed up, \"the parents were the father and the mother.\" the smut that was really science fell with a crash into the boys' eye-avoiding silence. \"mother,\" he repeated loudly rubbing in the science; and, leaning back in his chair, \"these,\" he said gravely, \"are unpleasant facts; i know it. but then most historical facts are unpleas- ant.\" he returned to little reuben-to little reuben, in whose room, one evening, by an oversight, his father and mother (crash, crash!) hap- pened to leave the radio turned on. (\"for you must remember that in those days of gross viviparous re- production, children were always brought up by their parents and not in state conditioning centres.\") while the child was asleep, a broadcast programme from london sud- denly started to come through; and the next morning, to the aston- ishment of his crash and crash (the more daring of the boys ventured to grin at one another), little reuben woke up repeating word for word a long lecture by that curious old writer (\"one of the very few whose works have been permitted to come down to us\"), george bernard shaw, who was speaking, according to a well-authenticated tradition, about his own genius. to little reuben's wink and snigger, this lecture was, of course, perfectly incomprehensible and, imagining that their child had suddenly gone mad, they sent for a doctor. he, fortunately, understood english, recognized the discourse as that which shaw had broadcasted the previous evening, realized the significance of what had happened, and sent a letter to the medical press about it. \"the principle of sleep-teaching, or hypnopaedia, had been discov- ered.\" the d.h.c. made an impressive pause. the principle had been discovered; but many, many years were to elapse before that principle was usefully applied. \"the case of little reuben occurred only twenty-three years after our ford's first t-model was put on the market.\" (here the director made a sign of the t on his stomach and all the students reverently followed suit.) \"and yet ...\" furiously the students scribbled. \"hypnopdedia, first used officially in a.f. 214. why not before? two reasons, (a) ...\" \"these early experimenters,\" the d.h.c. was saying, \"were on the wrong track. they thought that hypnopaedia could be made an instru- ment of intellectual education ...\" (a small boy asleep on his right side, the right arm stuck out, the right hand hanging limp over the edge of the bed. through a round grating in the side of a box a voice speaks softly. \"the nile is the longest river in africa and the second in length of all the rivers of the globe. although falling short of the length of the mississippi-missouri, the nile is at the head of all rivers as regards the length of its basin, which extends through 35 degrees of latitude ...\" at breakfast the next morning, \"tommy,\" some one says, \"do you know which is the longest river in africa?\" a shaking of the head. \"but don't you remember something that begins: the nile is the ...\" \"the - nile - is - the - longest - river - in - africa - and - the - second - in - length - of - all - the - rivers - of - the - globe ...\" the words come rushing out. \"although - falling - short - of ...\" \"well now, which is the longest river in africa?\" the eyes are blank. \"i don't know.\" \"but the nile, tommy.\" \"the - nile - is - the - longest - river - in - africa - and - second ...\" \"then which river is the longest, tommy?\" tommy burst into tears. \"i don't know,\" he howls.) that howl, the director made it plain, discouraged the earliest investi- gators. the experiments were abandoned. no further attempt was made to teach children the length of the nile in their sleep. quite rightly. you can't learn a science unless you know what it's all about. \"whereas, if they'd only started on moral education,\" said the director, leading the way towards the door. the students followed him, desper- ately scribbling as they walked and all the way up in the lift. \"moral education, which ought never, in any circumstances, to be rational.\" \"silence, silence,\" whispered a loud speaker as they stepped out at the fourteenth floor, and \"silence, silence,\" the trumpet mouths indefati- gably repeated at intervals down every corridor. the students and even the director himself rose automatically to the tips of their toes. they were alphas, of course, but even alphas have been well condi- tioned. \"silence, silence.\" all the air of the fourteenth floor was sibilant with the categorical imperative. fifty yards of tiptoeing brought them to a door which the director cau- tiously opened. they stepped over the threshold into the twilight of a shuttered dormitory. eighty cots stood in a row against the wall. there was a sound of light regular breathing and a continuous murmur, as of very faint voices remotely whispering. a nurse rose as they entered and came to attention before the direc- tor. \"what's the lesson this afternoon?\" he asked. \"we had elementary sex for the first forty minutes,\" she answered. \"but now it's switched over to elementary class consciousness.\" the director walked slowly down the long line of cots. rosy and re- laxed with sleep, eighty little boys and girls lay softly breathing. there was a whisper under every pillow. the d.h.c. halted and, bending over one of the little beds, listened attentively. \"elementary class consciousness, did you say? let's have it repeated a little louder by the trumpet.\" at the end of the room a loud speaker projected from the wall. the di- rector walked up to it and pressed a switch. \"... all wear green,\" said a soft but very distinct voice, beginning in the middle of a sentence, \"and delta children wear khaki. oh no, i don't want to play with delta children. and epsilons are still worse. they're too stupid to be able to read or write. besides they wear black, which is such a beastly colour. i'm so glad i'm a beta.\" there was a pause; then the voice began again. \"alpha children wear grey they work much harder than we do, be- cause they're so frightfully clever. i'm really awfuly glad i'm a beta, because i don't work so hard. and then we are much better than the gammas and deltas. gammas are stupid. they all wear green, and delta children wear khaki. oh no, i don't want to play with delta chil- dren. and epsilons are still worse. they're too stupid to be able ...\" the director pushed back the switch. the voice was silent. only its thin ghost continued to mutter from beneath the eighty pillows. \"they'll have that repeated forty or fifty times more before they wake; then again on thursday, and again on saturday. a hundred and twenty times three times a week for thirty months. after which they go on to a more advanced lesson.\" roses and electric shocks, the khaki of deltas and a whiff of asafceti- da-wedded indissolubly before the child can speak. but wordless con- ditioning is crude and wholesale; cannot bring home the finer distinc- tions, cannot inculcate the more complex courses of behaviour. for that there must be words, but words without reason. in brief, hyp- nopaedia. \"the greatest moralizing and socializing force of all time.\" the students took it down in their little books. straight from the horse's mouth. once more the director touched the switch. \"... so frightfully clever,\" the soft, insinuating, indefatigable voice was saying, \"i'm really awfully glad i'm a beta, because ...\" not so much like drops of water, though water, it is true, can wear holes in the hardest granite; rather, drops of liquid sealing-wax, drops that adhere, incrust, incorporate themselves with what they fall on, till finally the rock is all one scarlet blob. \"till at last the child's mind is these suggestions, and the sum of the suggestions is the child's mind. and not the child's mind only. the adult's mind too-all his life long. the mind that judges and desires and decides-made up of these suggestions. but all these suggestions are our suggestions!\" the director almost shouted in his triumph. \"sug- gestions from the state.\" he banged the nearest table. \"it therefore follows ...\" a noise made him turn round. \"oh, ford!\" he said in another tone, \"i've gone and woken the chil- dren.\" chapter three outside, in the garden, it was playtime. naked in the warm june sunshine, six or seven hundred little boys and girls were running with shrill yells over the lawns, or playing ball games, or squatting silently in twos and threes among the flowering shrubs. the roses were in bloom, two nightingales soliloquized in the boskage, a cuckoo was just going out of tune among the lime trees. the air was drowsy with the murmur of bees and helicopters. the director and his students stood for a short time watching a game of centrifugal bumble-puppy. twenty children were grouped in a circle round a chrome steel tower. a ball thrown up so as to land on the plat- form at the top of the tower rolled down into the interior, fell on a rap- idly revolving disk, was hurled through one or other of the numerous apertures pierced in the cylindrical casing, and had to be caught. \"strange,\" mused the director, as they turned away, \"strange to think that even in our ford's day most games were played without more ap- paratus than a ball or two and a few sticks and perhaps a bit of net- ting, imagine the folly of allowing people to play elaborate games which do nothing whatever to increase consumption. it's madness. nowadays the controllers won't approve of any new game unless it can be shown that it requires at least as much apparatus as the most complicated of existing games.\" he interrupted himself. \"that's a charming little group,\" he said, pointing. in a little grassy bay between tall clumps of mediterranean heather, two children, a little boy of about seven and a little girl who might have been a year older, were playing, very gravely and with all the fo- cussed attention of scientists intent on a labour of discovery, a rudi- mentary sexual game. \"charming, charming!\" the d.h.c. repeated sentimentally. \"charming,\" the boys politely agreed. but their smile was rather pa- tronizing. they had put aside similar childish amusements too recently to be able to watch them now without a touch of contempt. charming? but it was just a pair of kids fooling about; that was all. just kids. \"i always think,\" the director was continuing in the same rather maud- lin tone, when he was interrupted by a loud boo-hooing. from a neighbouring shrubbery emerged a nurse, leading by the hand a small boy, who howled as he went. an anxious-looking little girl trot- ted at her heels. \"what's the matter?\" asked the director. the nurse shrugged her shoulders. \"nothing much,\" she answered. \"it's just that this little boy seems rather reluctant to join in the ordi- nary erotic play. i'd noticed it once or twice before. and now again to- day. he started yelling just now ...\" \"honestly,\" put in the anxious-looking little girl, \"i didn't mean to hurt him or anything. honestly.\" \"of course you didn't, dear,\" said the nurse reassuringly. \"and so,\" she went on, turning back to the director, \"i'm taking him in to see the as- sistant superintendent of psychology. just to see if anything's at all abnormal.\" \"quite right,\" said the director. \"take him in. you stay here, little girl,\" he added, as the nurse moved away with her still howling charge. \"what's your name?\" \"polly trotsky.\" \"and a very good name too,\" said the director. \"run away now and see if you can find some other little boy to play with.\" the child scampered off into the bushes and was lost to sight. \"exquisite little creature!\" said the director, looking after her. then, turning to his students, \"what i'm going to tell you now,\" he said, \"may sound incredible. but then, when you're not accustomed to his- tory, most facts about the past do sound incredible.\" he let out the amazing truth. for a very long period before the time of our ford, and even for some generations afterwards, erotic play be- tween children had been regarded as abnormal (there was a roar of laughter); and not only abnormal, actually immoral (no!): and had therefore been rigorously suppressed. a look of astonished incredulity appeared on the faces of his listeners. poor little kids not allowed to amuse themselves? they could not be- lieve it. \"even adolescents,\" the d.h.c. was saying, \"even adolescents like yourselves ...\" \"not possible!\" \"barring a little surreptitious auto-erotism and homosexuality-abso- lutely nothing.\" \"nothing?\" \"in most cases, till they were over twenty years old.\" \"twenty years old?\" echoed the students in a chorus of loud disbelief. \"twenty,\" the director repeated. \"i told you that you'd find it incredi- ble.\" \"but what happened?\" they asked. \"what were the results?\" \"the results were terrible.\" a deep resonant voice broke startlingly into the dialogue. they looked around. on the fringe of the little group stood a stranger- a man of middle height, black-haired, with a hooked nose, full red lips, eyes very piercing and dark. \"terrible,\" he repeated. the d.h.c. had at that moment sat down on one of the steel and rub- ber benches conveniently scattered through the gardens; but at the sight of the stranger, he sprang to his feet and darted forward, his hand outstretched, smiling with all his teeth, effusive. \"controller! what an unexpected pleasure! boys, what are you thinking of? this is the controller; this is his fordship, mustapha mond.\" in the four thousand rooms of the centre the four thousand electric clocks simultaneously struck four. discarnate voices called from the trumpet mouths. \"main day-shift off duty. second day-shift take over. main day-shift off in the lift, on their way up to the changing rooms, henry foster and the assistant director of predestination rather pointedly turned their backs on bernard marx from the psychology bureau: averted them- selves from that unsavoury reputation. the faint hum and rattle of machinery still stirred the crimson air in the embryo store. shifts might come and go, one lupus-coloured face give place to another; majestically and for ever the conveyors crept forward with their load of future men and women. lenina crowne walked briskly towards the door. his fordship mustapha mond! the eyes of the saluting students almost popped out of their heads. mustapha mond! the resident controller for western europe! one of the ten world controllers. one of the ten ... and he sat down on the bench with the d.h.c, he was going to stay, to stay, yes, and actually talk to them ... straight from the horse's mouth. straight from the mouth of ford himself. two shrimp-brown children emerged from a neighbouring shrubbery, stared at them for a moment with large, astonished eyes, then re- turned to their amusements among the leaves. \"you all remember,\" said the controller, in his strong deep voice, \"you all remember, i suppose, that beautiful and inspired saying of our ford's: history is bunk. history,\" he repeated slowly, \"is bunk.\" he waved his hand; and it was as though, with an invisible feather wisk, he had brushed away a little dust, and the dust was harappa, was ur of the chaldees; some spider-webs, and they were thebes and babylon and cnossos and mycenae. whisk. whisk-and where was odysseus, where was job, where were jupiter and gotama and jesus?

(the controller's evocation was so vivid that one of the boys, more sensitive than the rest, turned pale at the mere description and was on the point of being sick.) lenina got out of the bath, toweled herself dry, took hold of a long flexible tube plugged into the wall, presented the nozzle to her breast, as though she meant to commit suicide, pressed down the trigger. a blast of warmed air dusted her with the finest talcum powder. eight different scents and eau-de-cologne were laid on in little taps over the wash-basin. she turned on the third from the left, dabbed herself with chypre and, carrying her shoes and stockings in her hand, went out to see if one of the vibro-vacuum machines were free. and home was as squalid psychically as physically. psychically, it was a rabbit hole, a midden, hot with the frictions of tightly packed life, reek- ing with emotion. what suffocating intimacies, what dangerous, in- sane, obscene relationships between the members of the family group! maniacally, the mother brooded over her children (her children) ... brooded over them like a cat over its kittens; but a cat that could talk, a cat that could say, \"my baby, my baby,\" over and over again. \"my baby, and oh, oh, at my breast, the little hands, the hunger, and that unspeakable agonizing pleasure! till at last my baby sleeps, my baby sleeps with a bubble of white milk at the corner of his mouth. my little baby sleeps ...\" \"yes,\" said mustapha mond, nodding his head, \"you may well shudder.\" \"who are you going out with to-night?\" lenina asked, returning from the vibro-vac like a pearl illuminated from within, pinkly glowing. \"nobody.\" lenina raised her eyebrows in astonishment. \"i've been feeling rather out of sorts lately,\" fanny explained. \"dr. wells advised me to have a pregnancy substitute.\" \"but, my dear, you're only nineteen. the first pregnancy substitute isn't compulsory till twenty-one.\" \"i know, dear. but some people are better if they begin earlier. dr. wells told me that brunettes with wide pelvises, like me, ought to have their first pregnancy substitute at seventeen. so i'm really two years late, not two years early.\" she opened the door of her locker and pointed to the row of boxes and labelled phials on the upper shelf. \"syrup of corpus luteum,\" lenina read the names aloud. \"ovarin, guaranteed fresh: not to be used after august 1st, a.f. 632. mammary gland extract: to be taken three times daily, be- fore meals, with a little water. placentin: 5cc to be in- jected intravenally every third day ... ugh!\" lenina shuddered. \"how i loathe intravenals, don't you?\" \"yes. but when they do one good ...\" fanny was a particularly sensible girl. our ford-or our freud, as, for some inscrutable reason, he chose to call himself whenever he spoke of psychological matters-our freud had been the first to reveal the appalling dangers of family life. the world was full of fathers-was therefore full of misery; full of moth- ers-therefore of every kind of perversion from sadism to chastity; full of brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts-full of madness and suicide. \"and yet, among the savages of samoa, in certain islands off the coast of new guinea ...\" the tropical sunshine lay like warm honey on the naked bodies of chil- dren tumbling promiscuously among the hibiscus blossoms. home was in any one of twenty palm-thatched houses. in the trobriands concep- tion was the work of ancestral ghosts; nobody had ever heard of a fa- ther. \"extremes,\" said the controller, \"meet. for the good reason that they were made to meet.\" \"dr. wells says that a three months' pregnancy substitute now will make all the difference to my health for the next three or four years.\" \"well, i hope he's right,\" said lenina. \"but, fanny, do you really mean to say that for the next three months you're not supposed to ...\" \"oh no, dear. only for a week or two, that's all. i shall spend the eve- ning at the club playing musical bridge. i suppose you're going out?\" lenina nodded. \"who with?\" \"henry foster.\" \"again?\" fanny's kind, rather moon-like face took on an incongruous expression of pained and disapproving astonishment. \"do you mean to tell me you're still going out with henry foster?\" mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters. but there were also hus- bands, wives, lovers. there were also monogamy and romance. \"though you probably don't know what those are,\" said mustapha mond. they shook their heads. family, monogamy, romance. everywhere exclusiveness, a narrow channelling of impulse and energy. \"but every one belongs to every one else,\" he concluded, citing the hypnopaedic proverb. the students nodded, emphatically agreeing with a statement which upwards of sixty-two thousand repetitions in the dark had made them accept, not merely as true, but as axiomatic, self-evident, utterly in- disputable. \"but after all,\" lenina was protesting, \"it's only about four months now since i've been having henry.\" \"only four months! i like that. and what's more,\" fanny went on, pointing an accusing finger, \"there's been nobody else except henry all that time. has there?\" lenina blushed scarlet; but her eyes, the tone of her voice remained defiant. \"no, there hasn't been any one else,\" she answered almost truculently. \"and i jolly well don't see why there should have been.\" \"oh, she jolly well doesn't see why there should have been,\" fanny re- peated, as though to an invisible listener behind lenina's left shoulder. then, with a sudden change of tone, \"but seriously,\" she said, \"i really do think you ought to be careful. it's such horribly bad form to go on and on like this with one man. at forty, or thirty-five, it wouldn't be so bad. but at your age, lenina! no, it really won't do. and you know how strongly the d.h.c. objects to anything intense or long-drawn. four months of henry foster, without having another man-why, he'd be fu- rious if he knew ...\" \"think of water under pressure in a pipe.\" they thought of it. \"i pierce it once,\" said the controller. \"what a jet!\" he pierced it twenty times. there were twenty piddling little fountains. \"my baby. my baby ...!\" \"mother!\" the madness is infectious. \"my love, my one and only, precious, precious ...\" mother, monogamy, romance. high spurts the fountain; fierce and foamy the wild jet. the urge has but a single outlet. my love, my baby. no wonder these poor pre-moderns were mad and wicked and miser- able. their world didn't allow them to take things easily, didn't allow them to be sane, virtuous, happy. what with mothers and lovers, what with the prohibitions they were not conditioned to obey, what with the temptations and the lonely remorses, what with all the diseases and the endless isolating pain, what with the uncertainties and the pover- ty-they were forced to feel strongly. and feeling strongly (and strongly, what was more, in solitude, in hopelessly individual isolation), how could they be stable? \"of course there's no need to give him up. have somebody else from time to time, that's all. he has other girls, doesn't he?\" lenina admitted it. \"of course he does. trust henry foster to be the perfect gentle- man-always correct. and then there's the director to think of. you know what a stickler ...\" nodding, \"he patted me on the behind this afternoon,\" said lenina. \"there, you see!\" fanny was triumphant. \"that shows what he stands for. the strictest conventionality.\" \"stability,\" said the controller, \"stability. no civilization without social stability. no social stability without individual stability.\" his voice was a trumpet. listening they felt larger, warmer. the machine turns, turns and must keep on turning-for ever. it is death if it stands still. a thousand millions scrabbled the crust of the earth. the wheels began to turn. in a hundred and fifty years there were two thousand millions. stop all the wheels. in a hundred and fifty weeks there are once more only a thousand millions; a thousand thou- sand thousand men and women have starved to death. wheels must turn steadily, but cannot turn untended. there must be men to tend them, men as steady as the wheels upon their axles, sane men, obedient men, stable in contentment. crying: my baby, my mother, my only, only love groaning: my sin, my terrible god; screaming with pain, muttering with fever, bemoaning old age and poverty-how can they tend the wheels? and if they cannot tend the wheels ... the corpses of a thousand thousand thousand men and women would be hard to bury or burn. \"and after all,\" fanny's tone was coaxing, \"it's not as though there were anything painful or disagreeable about having one or two men besides henry. and seeing that you ought to be a little more promiscu- ous ...\" \"stability,\" insisted the controller, \"stability. the primal and the ulti- mate need. stability. hence all this.\" with a wave of his hand he indicated the gardens, the huge building of the conditioning centre, the naked children furtive in the undergrowth or running across the lawns. lenina shook her head. \"somehow,\" she mused, \"i hadn't been feeling very keen on promiscuity lately. there are times when one doesn't. haven't you found that too, fanny?\" fanny nodded her sympathy and understanding. \"but one's got to make the effort,\" she said, sententiously, \"one's got to play the game. after all, every one belongs to every one else.\" \"yes, every one belongs to every one else,\" lenina repeated slowly and, sighing, was silent for a moment; then, taking fanny's hand, gave it a little squeeze. \"you're quite right, fanny. as usual. i'll make the effort.\" impulse arrested spills over, and the flood is feeling, the flood is pas- sion, the flood is even madness: it depends on the force of the current, the height and strength of the barrier. the unchecked stream flows smoothly down its appointed channels into a calm well-being. (the embryo is hungry; day in, day out, the blood-surrogate pump unceas- ingly turns its eight hundred revolutions a minute. the decanted infant howls; at once a nurse appears with a bottle of external secretion. feeling lurks in that interval of time between desire and its consum- mation. shorten that interval, break down all those old unnecessary barriers. \"fortunate boys!\" said the controller. \"no pains have been spared to make your lives emotionally easy-to preserve you, so far as that is possible, from having emotions at all.\" \"ford's in his flivver,\" murmured the d.h.c. \"all's well with the world.\" \"lenina crowne?\" said henry foster, echoing the assistant predestina- tor's question as he zipped up his trousers. \"oh, she's a splendid girl. wonderfully pneumatic. i'm surprised you haven't had her.\" \"i can't think how it is i haven't,\" said the assistant predestinator. \"i certainly will. at the first opportunity.\" from his place on the opposite side of the changing-room aisle, ber- nard marx overheard what they were saying and turned pale. \"and to tell the truth,\" said lenina, \"i'm beginning to get just a tiny bit bored with nothing but henry every day.\" she pulled on her left stock- ing. \"do you know bernard marx?\" she asked in a tone whose exces- sive casualness was evidently forced. fanny looked startled. \"you don't mean to say ...?\" \"why not? bernard's an alpha plus. besides, he asked me to go to one of the savage reservations with him. i've always wanted to see a sav- age reservation.\" \"but his reputation?\" \"what do i care about his reputation?\" \"they say he doesn't like obstacle golf.\" \"they say, they say,\" mocked lenina. \"and then he spends most of his time by himself-alone.\" there was horror in fanny's voice. \"well, he won't be alone when he's with me. and anyhow, why are people so beastly to him? i think he's rather sweet.\" she smiled to herself; how absurdly shy he had been! frightened almost-as though she were a world controller and he a gamma-minus machine minder. \"consider your own lives,\" said mustapha mond. \"has any of you ever encountered an insurmountable obstacle?\" the question was answered by a negative silence. \"has any of you been compelled to live through a long time-interval between the consciousness of a desire and its fufilment?\" \"well,\" began one of the boys, and hesitated. \"speak up,\" said the d.h.c. \"don't keep his fordship waiting.\" \"i once had to wait nearly four weeks before a girl i wanted would let me have her.\" \"and you felt a strong emotion in consequence?\" \"horrible!\" \"horrible; precisely,\" said the controller. \"our ancestors were so stupid and short-sighted that when the first reformers came along and of- fered to deliver them from those horrible emotions, they wouldn't have anything to do with them.\" \"talking about her as though she were a bit of meat.\" bernard ground his teeth. \"have her here, have her there.\" like mutton. degrading her to so much mutton. she said she'd think it over, she said she'd give me an answer this week. oh, ford, ford, ford.\" he would have liked to go up to them and hit them in the face-hard, again and again. \"yes, i really do advise you to try her,\" henry foster was saying. \"take ectogenesis. pfitzner and kawaguchi had got the whole tech- nique worked out. but would the governments look at it? no. there was something called christianity. women were forced to go on being viviparous.\" \"he's so ugly!\" said fanny. \"but i rather like his looks.\" \"and then so small.\" fanny made a grimace; smallness was so horribly and typically low-caste. \"i think that's rather sweet,\" said lenina. \"one feels one would like to pet him. you know. like a cat.\" fanny was shocked. \"they say somebody made a mistake when he was still in the bottle-thought he was a gamma and put alcohol into his blood-surrogate. that's why he's so stunted.\" \"what nonsense!\" lenina was indignant. \"sleep teaching was actually prohibited in england. there was some- thing called liberalism. parliament, if you know what that was, passed a law against it. the records survive. speeches about liberty of the subject. liberty to be inefficient and miserable. freedom to be a round peg in a square hole.\" \"but, my dear chap, you're welcome, i assure you. you're welcome.\" henry foster patted the assistant predestinator on the shoulder. \"every one belongs to every one else, after all.\" one hundred repetitions three nights a week for four years, thought bernard marx, who was a specialist on hypnopaedia. sixty-two thou- sand four hundred repetitions make one truth. idiots! \"or the caste system. constantly proposed, constantly rejected. there was something called democracy. as though men were more than physico-chemically equal.\" \"well, all i can say is that i'm going to accept his invitation.\" bernard hated them, hated them. but they were two, they were large, they were strong. \"the nine years' war began in a.f. 141.\" \"not even if it were true about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate.\" \"phosgene, chloropicrin, ethyl iodoacetate, diphenylcyanarsine, tri- chlormethyl, chloroformate, dichlorethyl sulphide. not to mention hy- drocyanic acid.\" \"which i simply don't believe,\" lenina concluded. \"the noise of fourteen thousand aeroplanes advancing in open order. but in the kurfurstendamm and the eighth arrondissement, the explo- sion of the anthrax bombs is hardly louder than the popping of a paper bag.\" \"because i do want to see a savage reservation.\" ch 3 c6h2(n02)3+hg(cno) 2 =well, what? an enormous hole in the ground, a pile of masonry, some bits of flesh and mucus, a foot, with the boot still on it, flying through the air and landing, flop, in the mid- dle of the geraniums-the scarlet ones; such a splendid show that summer! \"you're hopeless, lenina, i give you up.\" \"the russian technique for infecting water supplies was particularly in- genious.\" back turned to back, fanny and lenina continued their changing in si- lence. \"the nine years' war, the great economic collapse. there was a choice between world control and destruction. between stability and ...\" \"fanny crowne's a nice girl too,\" said the assistant predestinator. in the nurseries, the elementary class consciousness lesson was over, the voices were adapting future demand to future industrial supply. \"i do love flying,\" they whispered, \"i do love flying, i do love having new clothes, i do love ...\" \"liberalism, of course, was dead of anthrax, but all the same you couldn't do things by force.\" \"not nearly so pneumatic as lenina. oh, not nearly.\" \"but old clothes are beastly,\" continued the untiring whisper. \"we al- ways throw away old clothes. ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending, ending is better ...\" \"government's an affair of sitting, not hitting. you rule with the brains and the buttocks, never with the fists. for example, there was the conscription of consumption.\" \"there, i'm ready,\" said lenina, but fanny remained speechless and averted. \"let's make peace, fanny darling.\" \"every man, woman and child compelled to consume so much a year. in the interests of industry. the sole result ...\" \"ending is better than mending. the more stitches, the less riches; the more stitches ...\" \"one of these days,\" said fanny, with dismal emphasis, \"you'll get into trouble.\" \"conscientious objection on an enormous scale. anything not to con- sume. back to nature.\" \"i do love flying. i do love flying.\" \"back to culture. yes, actually to culture. you can't consume much if you sit still and read books.\" \"do i look all right?\" lenina asked. her jacket was made of bottle green acetate cloth with green viscose fur; at the cuffs and collar. \"eight hundred simple lifers were mowed down by machine guns at golders green.\" \"ending is better than mending, ending is better than mending.\" green corduroy shorts and white viscose-woollen stockings turned down below the knee. \"then came the famous british museum massacre. two thousand cul- ture fans gassed with dichlorethyl sulphide.\" a green-and-white jockey cap shaded lenina's eyes; her shoes were bright green and highly polished. \"in the end,\" said mustapha mond, \"the controllers realized that force was no good. the slower but infinitely surer methods of ectogenesis, neo-pavlovian conditioning and hypnopaedia ...\" and round her waist she wore a silver-mounted green morocco- surrogate cartridge belt, bulging (for lenina was not a freemartin) with the regulation supply of contraceptives. \"the discoveries of pfitzner and kawaguchi were at last made use of. an intensive propaganda against viviparous reproduction ...\" \"perfect!\" cried fanny enthusiastically. she could never resist lenina's charm for long. \"and what a perfectly sweet malthusian belt!\" \"accompanied by a campaign against the past; by the closing of mu- seums, the blowing up of historical monuments (luckily most of them had already been destroyed during the nine years' war); by the sup- pression of all books published before a.f. 150.\" i simply must get one like it,\" said fanny. there were some things called the pyramids, for example. my old black-patent bandolier ...\" and a man called shakespeare. you've never heard of them of course.\" 'it's an absolute disgrace-that bandolier of mine.\" 'such are the advantages of a really scientific education.\" 'the more stitches the less riches;

but all the same they used to drink enormous quantities of alcohol.\" 'like meat, like so much meat.\" 'there was a thing called the soul and a thing called immortality.\" 'do ask henry where he got it.\" 'but they used to take morphia and cocaine.\" 'and what makes it worse, she thinks of herself as meat.\" 'two thousand pharmacologists and bio-chemists were subsidized in a. p. 178.\" he does look glum,\" said the assistant predestinator, pointing at ber- nard marx. six years later it was being produced commercially. the perfect drug.\" let's bait him.\" euphoric, narcotic, pleasantly hallucinant.\" glum, marx, glum.\" the clap on the shoulder made him start, look up. it was that brute henry foster. \"what you need is a gramme of soma.\" all the advantages of christianity and alcohol; none of their defects.\" ford, i should like to kill him!\" but all he did was to say, \"no, thank you,\" and fend off the proffered tube of tablets. take a holiday from reality whenever you like, and come back without so much as a headache or a mythology.\" take it,\" insisted henry foster, \"take it.\" \"stability was practically assured.\" \"one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy sentiments,\" said the assis- tant predestinator citing a piece of homely hypnopaedic wisdom. \"it only remained to conquer old age.\" \"damn you, damn you!\" shouted bernard marx. \"hoity-toity.\" \"gonadal hormones, transfusion of young blood, magnesium salts ...\" \"and do remember that a gramme is better than a damn.\" they went out, laughing. \"all the physiological stigmata of old age have been abolished. and along with them, of course ...\" \"don't forget to ask him about that malthusian belt,\" said fanny. \"along with them all the old man's mental peculiarities. characters remain constant throughout a whole lifetime.\" \"... two rounds of obstacle golf to get through before dark. i must fly.\" \"work, play-at sixty our powers and tastes are what they were at sev- enteen. old men in the bad old days used to renounce, retire, take to religion, spend their time reading, thinking-thinking!\" \"idiots, swine!\" bernard marx was saying to himself, as he walked down the corridor to the lift. \"now-such is progress-the old men work, the old men copulate, the old men have no time, no leisure from pleasure, not a moment to sit down and think-or if ever by some unlucky chance such a crevice of time should yawn in the solid substance of their distractions, there is always soma, delicious soma, half a gramme for a half-holiday, a gramme for a week-end, two grammes for a trip to the gorgeous east, three for a dark eternity on the moon; returning whence they find themselves on the other side of the crevice, safe on the solid ground of daily labour and distraction, scampering from feely to feely, from girl to pneumatic girl, from electromagnetic golf course to ...\" \"go away, little girl,\" shouted the d.h.c. angrily. \"go away, little boy! can't you see that his fordship's busy? go and do your erotic play somewhere else.\" \"suffer little children,\" said the controller. slowly, majestically, with a faint humming of machinery, the conveyors moved forward, thirty-three centimters an hour. in the red darkness glinted innumerable rubies. chapter four the lift was crowded with men from the alpha changing rooms, and lenina's entry wars greeted by many friendly nods and smiles. she was a popular girl and, at one time or another, had spent a night with almost all of them. they were dear boys, she thought, as she returned their salutations. charming boys! still, she did wish that george edzel's ears weren't quite so big (perhaps he'd been given just a spot too much parathyroid at metre 328?). and looking at benito hoover, she couldn't help re- membering that he was really too hairy when he took his clothes off. turning, with eyes a little saddened by the recollection, of benito's curly blackness, she saw in a corner the small thin body, the melan- choly face of bernard marx. \"bernard!\" she stepped up to him. \"i was looking for you.\" her voice rang clear above the hum of the mounting lift. the others looked round curiously. \"i wanted to talk to you about our new mexico plan.\" out of the tail of her eye she could see benito hoover gaping with as- tonishment. the gape annoyed her. \"surprised i shouldn't be begging to go with him again!\" she said to herself. then aloud, and more warmly than ever, \"i'd simply love to come with you for a week in july,\" she went on. (anyhow, she was publicly proving her unfaithful- ness to henry. fanny ought to be pleased, even though it was ber- nard.) \"that is,\" lenina gave him her most deliciously significant smile, \"if you still want to have me.\" bernard's pale face flushed. \"what on earth for?\" she wondered, as- tonished, but at the same time touched by this strange tribute to her power. \"hadn't we better talk about it somewhere else?\" he stammered, look- ing horribly uncomfortable. \"as though i'd been saying something shocking,\" thought lenina. \"he couldn't look more upset if i'd made a dirty joke-asked him who his mother was, or something like that.\" \"i mean, with all these people about ...\" he was choked with confusion. lenina's laugh was frank and wholly unmalicious. \"how funny you are!\" she said; and she quite genuinely did think him funny. \"you'll give me at least a week's warning, won't you,\" she went on in another tone. \"i suppose we take the blue pacific rocket? does it start from the charing-t tower? or is it from hampstead?\" before bernard could answer, the lift came to a standstill. \"roof!\" called a creaking voice. the liftman was a small simian creature, dressed in the black tunic of an epsilon-minus semi-moron. \"roof!\" he flung open the gates. the warm glory of afternoon sunlight made him start and blink his eyes. \"oh, roof!\" he repeated in a voice of rap- ture. he was as though suddenly and joyfully awakened from a dark annihilating stupor. \"roof!\" he smiled up with a kind of doggily expectant adoration into the faces of his passengers. talking and laughing together, they stepped out into the light. the liftman looked after them. \"roof?\" he said once more, questioningly. then a bell rang, and from the ceiling of the lift a loud speaker began, very softly and yet very imperiously, to issue its commands. \"go down,\" it said, \"go down. floor eighteen. go down, go down. floor eighteen. go down, go ...\" the liftman slammed the gates, touched a button and instantly dropped back into the droning twilight of the well, the twilight of his own habitual stupor. it was warm and bright on the roof. the summer afternoon was drowsy with the hum of passing helicopters; and the deeper drone of the rocket-planes hastening, invisible, through the bright sky five or six miles overhead was like a caress on the soft air. bernard marx drew a deep breath. he looked up into the sky and round the blue horizon and finally down into lenina's face. \"isn't it beautiful!\" his voice trembled a little. she smiled at him with an expression of the most sympathetic under- standing. \"simply perfect for obstacle golf,\" she answered rapturously. \"and now i must fly, bernard. henry gets cross if i keep him waiting. let me know in good time about the date.\" and waving her hand she ran away across the wide flat roof towards the hangars. bernard stood watching the retreating twinkle of the white stockings, the sunburnt knees vivaciously bending and unbending again, again, and the softer rolling of those well-fitted corduroy shorts beneath the bottle green jacket. his face wore an expression of pain. \"i should say she was pretty,\" said a loud and cheery voice just behind him. bernard started and looked around. the chubby red face of benito hoover was beaming down at him-beaming with manifest cordiality. benito was notoriously good-natured. people said of him that he could have got through life without ever touching soma. the malice and bad tempers from which other people had to take holidays never afflicted him. reality for benito was always sunny. \"pneumatic too. and how!\" then, in another tone: \"but, i say,\" he went on, \"you do look glum! what you need is a gramme of soma.\" diving into his right-hand trouser-pocket, benito produced a phial. \"one cubic centimetre cures ten gloomy ... but, i say!\" bernard had suddenly turned and rushed away. benito stared after him. \"what can be the matter with the fellow?\" he wondered, and, shaking his head, decided that the story about the al- cohol having been put into the poor chap's blood-surrogate must be true. \"touched his brain, i suppose.\" he put away the soma bottle, and taking out a packet of sex-hormone chewing-gum, stuffed a plug into his cheek and walked slowly away towards the hangars, ruminating. henry foster had had his machine wheeled out of its lock-up and, when lenina arrived, was already seated in the cockpit, waiting. \"four minutes late,\" was all his comment, as she climbed in beside him. he started the engines and threw the helicopter screws into gear. the machine shot vertically into the air. henry accelerated; the hum- ming of the propeller shrilled from hornet to wasp, from wasp to mos- quito; the speedometer showed that they were rising at the best part of two kilometres a minute. london diminished beneath them. the huge table-topped buildings were no more, in a few seconds, than a bed of geometrical mushrooms sprouting from the green of park and garden. in the midst of them, thin-stalked, a taller, slenderer fungus, the charing-t tower lifted towards the sky a disk of shining concrete. like the vague torsos of fabulous athletes, huge fleshy clouds lolled on the blue air above their heads. out of one of them suddenly dropped a small scarlet insect, buzzing as it fell. \"there's the red rocket,\" said henry, \"just come in from new york.\" looking at his watch. \"seven minutes behind time,\" he added, and shook his head. \"these atlantic services-they're really scandalously unpunctual.\" he took his foot off the accelerator. the humming of the screws over- head dropped an octave and a half, back through wasp and hornet to bumble bee, to cockchafer, to stag-beetle. the upward rush of the ma- chine slackened off; a moment later they were hanging motionless in the air. henry pushed at a lever; there was a click. slowly at first, then faster and faster, till it was a circular mist before their eyes, the pro- peller in front of them began to revolve. the wind of a horizontal speed whistled ever more shrilly in the stays. henry kept his eye on the revolution-counter; when the needle touched the twelve hundred mark, he threw the helicopter screws out of gear. the machine had enough forward momentum to be able to fly on its planes. lenina looked down through the window in the floor between her feet. they were flying over the six kilometre zone of park-land that sepa- rated central london from its first ring of satellite suburbs. the green was maggoty with fore-shortened life. forests of centrifugal bumble- puppy towers gleamed between the trees. near shepherd's bush two thousand beta-minus mixed doubles were playing riemann-surface tennis. a double row of escalator fives courts lined the main road from notting hill to willesden. in the ealing stadium a delta gymnastic display and community sing was in progress. \"what a hideous colour khaki is,\" remarked lenina, voicing the hyp- nopaedic prejudices of her caste. the buildings of the hounslow feely studio covered seven and a half hectares. near them a black and khaki army of labourers was busy re- vitrifying the surface of the great west road. one of the huge travel- ling crucibles was being tapped as they flew over. the molten stone poured out in a stream of dazzling incandescence across the road, the asbestos rollers came and went; at the tail of an insulated watering cart the steam rose in white clouds. at brentford the television corporation's factory was like a small town. \"they must be changing the shift,\" said lenina. like aphides and ants, the leaf-green gamma girls, the black semi- morons swarmed round the entrances, or stood in queues to take their places in the monorail tram-cars. mulberry-coloured beta-minuses came and went among the crowd. the roof of the main building was alive with the alighting and departure of helicopters. \"my word,\" said lenina, \"i'm glad i'm not a gamma.\" ten minutes later they were at stoke poges and had started their first round of obstacle golf. â§2 with eyes for the most part downcast and, if ever they lighted on a fellow creature, at once and furtively averted, bernard hastened across the roof. he was like a man pursued, but pursued by enemies he does not wish to see, lest they should seem more hostile even than he had supposed, and he himself be made to feel guiltier and even more help- lessly alone. \"that horrible benito hoover!\" and yet the man had meant well enough. which only made it, in a way, much worse. those who meant well behaved in the same way as those who meant badly. even lenina was making him suffer. he remembered those weeks of timid indeci- sion, during which he had looked and longed and despaired of ever having the courage to ask her. dared he face the risk of being humili- ated by a contemptuous refusal? but if she were to say yes, what rap- ture! well, now she had said it and he was still wretched-wretched that she should have thought it such a perfect afternoon for obstacle golf, that she should have trotted away to join henry foster, that she should have found him funny for not wanting to talk of their most pri- vate affairs in public. wretched, in a word, because she had behaved as any healthy and virtuous english girl ought to behave and not in some other, abnormal, extraordinary way. he opened the door of his lock-up and called to a lounging couple of delta-minus attendants to come and push his machine out on to the roof. the hangars were staffed by a single bokanovsky group, and the men were twins, identically small, black and hideous. bernard gave his orders in the sharp, rather arrogant and even offensive tone of one who does not feel himself too secure in his superiority. to have deal- ings with members of the lower castes was always, for bernard, a most distressing experience. for whatever the cause (and the current gossip about the alcohol in his blood-surrogate may very likely-for ac- cidents will happen-have been true) bernard's physique as hardly bet- ter than that of the average gamma. he stood eight centimetres short of the standard alpha height and was slender in proportion. contact with members of he lower castes always reminded him painfully of this physical inadequacy. \"i am i, and wish i wasn't\"; his self- consciousness was acute and stressing. each time he found himself looking on the level, instead of downward, into a delta's face, he felt humiliated. would the creature treat him with the respect due to his caste? the question haunted him. not without reason. for gammas, deltas and epsilons had been to some extent conditioned to associate corporeal mass with social superiority. indeed, a faint hypnopaedic prejudice in favour of size was universal. hence the laughter of the women to whom he made proposals, the practical joking of his equals among the men. the mockery made him feel an outsider; and feeling an outsider he behaved like one, which increased the prejudice against him and intensified the contempt and hostility aroused by his physical defects. which in turn increased his sense of being alien and alone. a chronic fear of being slighted made him avoid his equals, made him stand, where his inferiors were concerned, self-consciously on his dig- nity. how bitterly he envied men like henry foster and benito hoover! men who never had to shout at an epsilon to get an order obeyed; men who took their position for granted; men who moved through the caste system as a fish through water-so utterly at home as to be un- aware either of themselves or of the beneficent and comfortable ele- ment in which they had their being. slackly, it seemed to him, and with reluctance, the twin attendants wheeled his plane out on the roof. \"hurry up!\" said bernard irritably. one of them glanced at him. was that a kind of bestial derision that he detected in those blank grey eyes? \"hurry up!\" he shouted more loudly, and there was an ugly rasp in his voice. he climbed into the plane and, a minute later, was flying southwards, towards the river. the various bureaux of propaganda and the college of emotional engi- neering were housed in a single sixty-story building in fleet street. in the basement and on the low floors were the presses and offices of the three great london newspapers-777e hourly radio, an upper-caste sheet, the pale green gamma gazette, and, on khaki paper and in words exclusively of one syllable, the delta mirror. then came the bu- reaux of propaganda by television, by feeling picture, and by syn- thetic voice and music respectively-twenty-two floors of them. above were the search laboratories and the padded rooms in which sound- track writers and synthetic composers did the delicate work. the top eighteen floors were occupied the college of emotional engineering. bernard landed on the roof of propaganda house and stepped out. \"ring down to mr. helmholtz watson,\" he ordered the gamma-plus porter, \"and tell him that mr. bernard marx is waiting for him on the roof.\" he sat down and lit a cigarette. helmholtz watson was writing when the message came down. \"tell him i'm coming at once,\" he said and hung up the receiver. then, turning to his secretary, \"i'll leave you to put my things away,\" he went on in the same official and impersonal tone; and, ignoring her lustrous smile, got up and walked briskly to the door. he was a powerfully built man, deep-chested, broad-shouldered, mas- sive, and yet quick in his movements, springy and agile. the round strong pillar of his neck supported a beautifully shaped head. his hair was dark and curly, his features strongly marked. in a forcible em- phatic way, he was handsome and looked, as his secretary was never tired of repeating, every centimetre an alpha plus. by profession he was a lecturer at the college of emotional engineering (department of writing) and the intervals of his educational activities, a working emo- tional engineer. he wrote regularly for the hourly radio, composed feely scenarios, and had the happiest knack for slogans and hyp- nopaedic rhymes. \"able,\" was the verdict of his superiors. \"perhaps, (and they would shake their heads, would significantly lower their voices) \"a little too able.\" yes, a little too able; they were right. a mental excess had produced in helmholtz watson effects very similar to those which, in bernard marx, were the result of a physical defect. too little bone and brawn had iso- lated bernard from his fellow men, and the sense of this apartness, being, by all the current standards, a mental excess, became in its turn a cause of wider separation. that which had made helmholtz so uncomfortably aware of being himself and all alone was too much abil- ity. what the two men shared was the knowledge that they were indi- viduals. but whereas the physically defective bernard had suffered all his life from the consciousness of being separate, it was only quite re- cently that, grown aware of his mental excess, helmholtz watson had also become aware of his difference from the people who surrounded him. this escalator-squash champion, this indefatigable lover (it was said that he had had six hundred and forty different girls in under four years), this admirable committee man and best mixer had realized quite suddenly that sport, women, communal activities were only, so far as he was concerned, second bests. really, and at the bottom, he was interested in something else. but in what? in what? that was the problem which bernard had come to discuss with him-or rather, since it was always helmholtz who did all the talking, to listen to his friend discussing, yet once more. three charming girls from the bureau of propaganda by synthetic voice waylaid him as he stepped out of the lift. \"oh, helmholtz, darling, do come and have a picnic supper with us on exmoor.\" they clung round him imploringly. he shook his head, he pushed his way through them. \"no, no.\" \"we're not inviting any other man.\" but helmholtz remained unshaken even by this delightful promise. \"no,\" he repeated, \"i'm busy.\" and he held resolutely on his course. the girls trailed after him. it was not till he had actually climbed into bernard's plane and slammed the door that they gave up pursuit. not without reproaches. \"these women!\" he said, as the machine rose into the air. \"these women!\" and he shook his head, he frowned. \"too awful,\" bernard hypocritically agreed, wishing, as he spoke the words, that he could have as many girls as helmholtz did, and with as little trouble. he was seized with a sudden urgent need to boast. \"i'm taking lenina crowne to new mexico with me,\" he said in a tone as casual as he could make it. \"are you?\" said helmholtz, with a total absence of interest. then after a little pause, \"this last week or two,\" he went on, \"i've been cutting all my committees and all my girls. you can't imagine what a hullaba- loo they've been making about it at the college. still, it's been worth it, i think. the effects ...\" he hesitated. \"well, they're odd, they're very odd.\" a physical shortcoming could produce a kind of mental excess. the process, it seemed, was reversible. mental excess could produce, for its own purposes, the voluntary blindness and deafness of deliberate solitude, the artificial impotence of asceticism. the rest of the short flight was accomplished in silence. when they had arrived and were comfortably stretched out on the pneumatic so- fas in bernard's room, helmholtz began again. speaking very slowly, \"did you ever feel,\" he asked, \"as though you had something inside you that was only waiting for you to give it a chance to come out? some sort of extra power that you aren't us- ing-you know, like all the water that goes down the falls instead of through the turbines?\" he looked at bernard questioningly. \"you mean all the emotions one might be feeling if things were differ- ent?\" helmholtz shook his head. \"not quite. i'm thinking of a queer feeling i sometimes get, a feeling that i've got something important to say and the power to say it-only i don't know what it is, and i can't make any use of the power. if there was some different way of writing ... or else something else to write about ...\" he was silent; then, \"you see,\" he went on at last, \"i'm pretty good at inventing phrases-you know, the sort of words that suddenly make you jump, almost as though you'd sat on a pin, they seem so new and exciting even though they're about something hypnopaedically obvious. but that doesn't seem enough. it's not enough for the phrases to be good; what you make with them ought to be good too.\" \"but your things are good, helmholtz.\" \"oh, as far as they go.\" helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. \"but they go such a little way. they aren't important enough, somehow. i feel i could do something much more important. yes, and more intense, more violent. but what? what is there more important to say? and how can one be violent about the sort of things one's expected to write about? words can be like x-rays, if you use them properly-they'll go through anything. you read and you're pierced. that's one of the things i try to teach my students-how to write piercingly. but what on earth's the good of being pierced by an article about a community sing, or the latest improvement in scent organs? besides, can you make words really piercing-you know, like the very hardest x- rays-when you're writing about that sort of thing? can you say some- thing about nothing? that's what it finally boils down to. i try and i try \"hush!\" said bernard suddenly, and lifted a warning finger; they lis- tened. \"i believe there's somebody at the door,\" he whispered. helmholtz got up, tiptoed across the room, and with a sharp quick movement flung the door wide open. there was, of course, nobody there. \"i'm sorry,\" said bernard, feeling and looking uncomfortably foolish. \"i suppose i've got things on my nerves a bit. when people are suspi- cious with you, you start being suspicious with them.\" he passed his hand across his eyes, he sighed, his voice became plain- tive. he was justifying himself. \"if you knew what i'd had to put up with recently,\" he said almost tearfully-and the uprush of his self-pity was like a fountain suddenly released. \"if you only knew!\" helmholtz watson listened with a certain sense of discomfort. \"poor lit- tle bernard!\" he said to himself. but at the same time he felt rather ashamed for his friend. he wished bernard would show a little more pride. chapter five by eight o'clock the light was failing. the loud speaker in the tower of the stoke poges club house began, in a more than human tenor, to announce the closing of the courses. lenina and henry abandoned their game and walked back towards the club. from the grounds of the internal and external secretion trust came the lowing of those thousands of cattle which provided, with their hormones and their milk, the raw materials for the great factory at farnham royal. an incessant buzzing of helicopters filled the twilight. every two and a half minutes a bell and the screech of whistles announced the depar- ture of one of the light monorail trains which carried the lower caste golfers back from their separate course to the metropolis. lenina and henry climbed into their machine and started off. at eight hundred feet henry slowed down the helicopter screws, and they hung for a minute or two poised above the fading landscape. the forest of burnham beeches stretched like a great pool of darkness towards the bright shore of the western sky. crimson at the horizon, the last of the sunset faded, through orange, upwards into yellow and a pale watery green. northwards, beyond and above the trees, the internal and ex- ternal secretions factory glared with a fierce electric brilliance from every window of its twenty stories. beneath them lay the buildings of the golf club-the huge lower caste barracks and, on the other side of a dividing wall, the smaller houses reserved for alpha and beta mem- bers. the approaches to the monorail station were black with the ant- like pullulation of lower-caste activity. from under the glass vault a lighted train shot out into the open. following its southeasterly course across the dark plain their eyes were drawn to the majestic buildings of the slough crematorium. for the safety of night-flying planes, its four tall chimneys were flood-lighted and tipped with crimson danger signals. it was a landmark. \"why do the smoke-stacks have those things like balconies around them?\" enquired lenina. \"phosphorus recovery,\" explained henry telegraphically. \"on their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments. p2o5 used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated some one. now they recover over ninety-eight per cent of it. more than a kilo and a half per adult corpse. which makes the best part of four hundred tons of phosphorus every year from england alone.\" henry spoke with a happy pride, rejoicing whole-heartedly in the achievement, as though it had been his own. \"fine to think we can go on being socially useful even after we're dead. making plants grow.\" lenina, meanwhile, had turned her eyes away and was looking per- pendicularly downwards at the monorail station. \"fine,\" she agreed. \"but queer that alphas and betas won't make any more plants grow than those nasty little gammas and deltas and epsilons down there.\" \"all men are physico-chemically equal,\" said henry sententiously. \"be- sides, even epsilons perform indispensable services.\" \"even an epsilon ...\" lenina suddenly remembered an occasion when, as a little girl at school, she had woken up in the middle of the night and become aware, for the first time, of the whispering that had haunted all her sleeps. she saw again the beam of moonlight, the row of small white beds; heard once more the soft, soft voice that said (the words were there, unforgotten, unforgettable after so many night-long repetitions): \"every one works for every one else. we can't do without any one. even epsilons are useful. we couldn't do without epsilons. every one works for every one else. we can't do without any one ...\" lenina remembered her first shock of fear and surprise; her specula- tions through half a wakeful hour; and then, under the influence of those endless repetitions, the gradual soothing of her mind, the sooth- ing, the smoothing, the stealthy creeping of sleep. ... \"i suppose epsilons don't really mind being epsilons,\" she said aloud. \"of course they don't. how can they? they don't know what it's like being anything else. we'd mind, of course. but then we've been differ- ently conditioned. besides, we start with a different heredity.\" \"i'm glad i'm not an epsilon,\" said lenina, with conviction. \"and if you were an epsilon,\" said henry, \"your conditioning would have made you no less thankful that you weren't a beta or an alpha.\" he put his forward propeller into gear and headed the machine to- wards london. behind them, in the west, the crimson and orange were almost faded; a dark bank of cloud had crept into the zenith. as they flew over the crematorium, the plane shot upwards on the column of hot air rising from the chimneys, only to fall as suddenly when it passed into the descending chill beyond. \"what a marvellous switchback!\" lenina laughed delightedly. but henry's tone was almost, for a moment, melancholy. \"do you know what that switchback was?\" he said. \"it was some human being finally and definitely disappearing. going up in a squirt of hot gas. it would be curious to know who it was-a man or a woman, an alpha or an epsilon. ...\" he sighed. then, in a resolutely cheerful voice, \"any- how,\" he concluded, \"there's one thing we can be certain of; whoever he may have been, he was happy when he was alive. everybody's happy now.\" \"yes, everybody's happy now,\" echoed lenina. they had heard the words repeated a hundred and fifty times every night for twelve years. landing on the roof of henry's forty-story apartment house in west- minster, they went straight down to the dining-hall. there, in a loud and cheerful company, they ate an excellent meal. soma was served with the coffee. lenina took two half-gramme tablets and henry three. at twenty past nine they walked across the street to the newly opened westminster abbey cabaret. it was a night almost without clouds, moonless and starry; but of this on the whole depressing fact lenina and henry were fortunately unaware. the electric sky-signs effectively shut off the outer darkness. \"calvin stopes and his sixteen sexophonists.\" from the fagade of the new abbey the giant letters invitingly glared. \"london's finest scent and colour organ. all the latest synthetic music.\" they entered. the air seemed hot and somehow breathless with the scent of ambergris and sandalwood. on the domed ceiling of the hall, the colour organ had momentarily painted a tropical sunset. the six- teen sexophonists were playing an old favourite: \"there ain't no bottle in all the world like that dear little bottle of mine.\" four hundred cou- ples were five-stepping round the polished floor. lenina and henry were soon the four hundred and first. the saxophones wailed like me- lodious cats under the moon, moaned in the alto and tenor registers as though the little death were upon them. rich with a wealth of harmon- ics, their tremulous chorus mounted towards a climax, louder and ever louder-until at last, with a wave of his hand, the conductor let loose the final shattering note of ether-music and blew the sixteen merely human blowers clean out of existence. thunder in a flat major. and then, in all but silence, in all but darkness, there followed a gradual deturgescence, a diminuendo sliding gradually, through quarter tones, down, down to a faintly whispered dominant chord that lingered on (while the five-four rhythms still pulsed below) charging the darkened seconds with an intense expectancy. and at last expectancy was ful- filled. there was a sudden explosive sunrise, and simultaneously, the sixteen burst into song: \"bottle of mine, it's you i've always wanted! bottle of mine, why was i ever decanted? skies are blue inside of you, the weather's always fine; for there ain 't no bottle in all the world like that dear little bottle of mine. \" five-stepping with the other four hundred round and round westmin- ster abbey, lenina and henry were yet dancing in another world-the warm, the richly coloured, the infinitely friendly world of soma-holiday. how kind, how good-looking, how delightfully amusing every one was! \"bottle of mine, it's you i've always wanted ...\" but lenina and henry had what they wanted ... they were inside, here and now-safely inside with the fine weather, the perennially blue sky. and when, exhausted, the sixteen had laid by their saxophones and the synthetic music ap- paratus was producing the very latest in slow malthusian blues, they might have been twin embryos gently rocking together on the waves of a bottled ocean of blood-surrogate. \"good-night, dear friends. good-night, dear friends.\" the loud speak- ers veiled their commands in a genial and musical politeness. \"good- night, dear friends ...\" obediently, with all the others, lenina and henry left the building. the depressing stars had travelled quite some way across the heavens. but though the separating screen of the sky-signs had now to a great ex- tent dissolved, the two young people still retained their happy igno- rance of the night. swallowing half an hour before closing time, that second dose of soma had raised a quite impenetrable wall between the actual universe and their minds. bottled, they crossed the street; bottled, they took the lift up to henry's room on the twenty-eighth floor. and yet, bottled as she was, and in spite of that second gramme of soma, lenina did not for- get to take all the contraceptive precautions prescribed by the regula- tions. years of intensive hypnopaedia and, from twelve to seventeen, malthusian drill three times a week had made the taking of these pre- cautions almost as automatic and inevitable as blinking. \"oh, and that reminds me,\" she said, as she came back from the bath- room, \"fanny crowne wants to know where you found that lovely green morocco-surrogate cartridge belt you gave me.\" â§2 alternate thursdays were bernard's solidarity service days. after an early dinner at the aphroditzeum (to which helrnholtz had recently been elected under rule two) he took leave of his friend and, hailing a taxi on the roof told the man to fly to the fordson community singery. the machine rose a couple of hundred metres, then headed eastwards, and as it turned, there before bernard's eyes, gigantically beautiful, was the singery. flood-lighted, its three hundred and twenty metres of white carrara-surrogate gleamed with a snowy incandescence over ludgate hill; at each of the four corners of its helicopter platform an immense t shone crimson against the night, and from the mouths of twenty-four vast golden trumpets rumbled a solemn synthetic music. \"damn, i'm late,\" bernard said to himself as he first caught sight of big henry, the singery clock. and sure enough, as he was paying off his cab, big henry sounded the hour. \"ford,\" sang out an immense bass voice from all the golden trumpets. \"ford, ford, ford ...\" nine times. bernard ran for the lift. the great auditorium for ford's day celebrations and other massed community sings was at the bottom of the building. above it, a hun- dred to each floor, were the seven thousand rooms used by solidarity groups for their fortnight services. bernard dropped down to floor thirty-three, hurried along the corridor, stood hesitating for a moment outside room 3210, then, having wound himself up, opened the door and walked in. thank ford! he was not the last. three chairs of the twelve arranged round the circular table were still unoccupied. he slipped into the nearest of them as inconspicuously as he could and prepared to frown at the yet later comers whenever they should arrive. turning towards him, \"what were you playing this afternoon?\" the girl on his left enquired. \"obstacle, or electro-magnetic?\" bernard looked at her (ford! it was morgana rothschild) and blushingly had to admit that he had been playing neither. morgana stared at him with astonishment. there was an awkward silence. then pointedly she turned away and addressed herself to the more sporting man on her left. \"a good beginning for a solidarity service,\" thought bernard miserably, and foresaw for himself yet another failure to achieve atonement. if only he had given himself time to look around instead of scuttling for the nearest chair! he could have sat between fifi bradlaugh and jo- anna diesel. instead of which he had gone and blindly planted himself next to morgana. morgana! ford! those black eyebrows of hers-that eyebrow, rather-for they met above the nose. ford! and on his right was clara deterding. true, clara's eyebrows didn't meet. but she was really too pneumatic. whereas fifi and joanna were absolutely right. plump, blonde, not too large ... and it was that great lout, tom kawa- guchi, who now took the seat between them. the last arrival was sarojini engels. \"you're late,\" said the president of the group severely. \"don't let it happen again.\" sarojini apologized and slid into her place between jim bokanovsky and herbert bakunin. the group was now complete, the solidarity cir- cle perfect and without flaw. man, woman, man, in a ring of endless alternation round the table. twelve of them ready to be made one, waiting to come together, to be fused, to lose their twelve separate identities in a larger being. the president stood up, made the sign of the t and, switching on the synthetic music, let loose the soft indefatigable beating of drums and a choir of instruments-near-wind and super-string-that plangently re- peated and repeated the brief and unescapably haunting melody of the first solidarity hymn. again, again-and it was not the ear that heard the pulsing rhythm, it was the midriff; the wail and clang of those re- curring harmonies haunted, not the mind, but the yearning bowels of compassion. the president made another sign of the t and sat down. the service had begun. the dedicated soma tablets were placed in the centre of the table. the loving cup of strawberry ice-cream soma was passed from hand to hand and, with the formula, \"i drink to my annihilation,\" twelve times quaffed. then to the accompaniment of the synthetic or- chestra the first solidarity hymn was sung. \"ford, we are twelve; oh, make us one, like drops within the social river, oh, make us now together run as swiftly as thy shining flivver. \" twelve yearning stanzas. and then the loving cup was passed a second time. \"i drink to the greater being\" was now the formula. all drank. tirelessly the music played. the drums beat. the crying and clashing of the harmonies were an obsession in the melted bowels. the second solidarity hymn was sung. \"come, greater being, social friend, annihilating twelve-in-one! we long to die, for when we end, our larger life has but begun. \" again twelve stanzas. by this time the soma had begun to work. eyes shone, cheeks were flushed, the inner light of universal benevolence broke out on every face in happy, friendly smiles. even bernard felt himself a little melted. when morgana rothschild turned and beamed at him, he did his best to beam back. but the eyebrow, that black two- in-one-alas, it was still there; he couldn't ignore it, couldn't, however hard he tried. the melting hadn't gone far enough. perhaps if he had been sitting between fifi and joanna ... for the third time the loving cup went round; \"i drink to the imminence of his coming,\" said mor- gana rothschild, whose turn it happened to be to initiate the circular rite. her tone was loud, exultant. she drank and passed the cup to bernard. \"i drink to the imminence of his coming,\" he repeated, with a sincere attempt to feel that the coming was imminent; but the eye- brow continued to haunt him, and the coming, so far as he was con- cerned, was horribly remote. he drank and handed the cup to clara deterding. \"it'll be a failure again,\" he said to himself. \"i know it will.\" but he went on doing his best to beam. the loving cup had made its circuit. lifting his hand, the president gave a signal; the chorus broke out into the third solidarity hymn. \"feel how the greater being comes! rejoice and, in rejoicings, die! melt in the music of the drums! for i am you and you are i. \" as verse succeeded verse the voices thrilled with an ever intenser ex- citement. the sense of the coming's imminence was like an electric tension in the air. the president switched off the music and, with the final note of the final stanza, there was absolute silence-the silence of stretched expectancy, quivering and creeping with a galvanic life. the president reached out his hand; and suddenly a voice, a deep strong voice, more musical than any merely human voice, richer, warmer, more vibrant with love and yearning and compassion, a wonderful, mysterious, supernatural voice spoke from above their heads. very slowly, \"oh, ford, ford, ford,\" it said diminishingly and on a descend- ing scale. a sensation of warmth radiated thrillingly out from the solar plexus to every extremity of the bodies of those who listened; tears came into their eyes; their hearts, their bowels seemed to move within them, as though with an independent life. \"ford!\" they were melting, \"ford!\" dissolved, dissolved. then, in another tone, suddenly, star- tlingly. \"listen!\" trumpeted the voice. \"listen!\" they listened. after a pause, sunk to a whisper, but a whisper, somehow, more penetrating than the loudest cry. \"the feet of the greater being,\" it went on, and repeated the words: \"the feet of the greater being.\" the whisper al- most expired. \"the feet of the greater being are on the stairs.\" and once more there was silence; and the expectancy, momentarily re- laxed, was stretched again, tauter, tauter, almost to the tearing point. the feet of the greater being-oh, they heard them, they heard them, coming softly down the stairs, coming nearer and nearer down the in- visible stairs. the feet of the greater being. and suddenly the tearing point was reached. her eyes staring, her lips parted. morgana rothschild sprang to her feet. \"i hear him,\" she cried. \"i hear him.\" \"he's coming,\" shouted sarojini engels. \"yes, he's coming, i hear him.\" fifi bradlaugh and tom kawaguchi rose simultaneously to their feet. \"oh, oh, oh!\" joanna inarticulately testified. \"he's coming!\" yelled jim bokanovsky. the president leaned forward and, with a touch, released a delirium of cymbals and blown brass, a fever of tom-tomming. \"oh, he's coming!\" screamed clara deterding. \"aie!\" and it was as though she were having her throat cut. feeling that it was time for him to do something, bernard also jumped up and shouted: \"i hear him; he's coming.\" but it wasn't true. he heard nothing and, for him, nobody was coming. nobody-in spite of the music, in spite of the mounting excitement. but he waved his arms, he shouted with the best of them; and when the others began to jig and stamp and shuffle, he also jigged and shuffled. round they went, a circular procession of dancers, each with hands on the hips of the dancer preceding, round and round, shouting in unison, stamping to the rhythm of the music with their feet, beating it, beating it out with hands on the buttocks in front; twelve pairs of hands beat- ing as one; as one, twelve buttocks slabbily resounding. twelve as one, twelve as one. \"i hear him, i hear him coming.\" the music quick- ened; faster beat the feet, faster, faster fell the rhythmic hands. and all at once a great synthetic bass boomed out the words which an- nounced the approaching atonement and final consummation of soli- darity, the coming of the twelve-in-one, the incarnation of the greater being. \"orgy-porgy,\" it sang, while the tom-toms continued to beat their feverish tattoo: \"orgy-porgy, ford and fun, kiss the girls and make them one. boys at one with girls at peace; orgy-porgy gives release. \" \"orgy-porgy,\" the dancers caught up the liturgical refrain, \"orgy-porgy, ford and fun, kiss the girls ...\" and as they sang, the lights began slowly to fade-to fade and at the same time to grow warmer, richer, redder, until at last they were dancing in the crimson twilight of an embryo store. \"orgy-porgy ...\" in their blood-coloured and foetal dark- ness the dancers continued for a while to circulate, to beat and beat out the indefatigable rhythm. \"orgy-porgy ...\" then the circle wavered, broke, fell in partial disintegration on the ring of couches which sur- rounded-circle enclosing circle-the table and its planetary chairs. \"orgy-porgy ...\" tenderly the deep voice crooned and cooed; in the red twilight it was as though some enormous negro dove were hovering benevolently over the now prone or supine dancers. they were standing on the roof; big henry had just sung eleven. the night was calm and warm. \"wasn't it wonderful?\" said fifi bradlaugh. \"wasn't it simply wonder- ful?\" she looked at bernard with an expression of rapture, but of rap- ture in which there was no trace of agitation or excitement-for to be excited is still to be unsatisfied. hers was the calm ecstasy of achieved consummation, the peace, not of mere vacant satiety and nothingness, but of balanced life, of energies at rest and in equilibrium. a rich and living peace. for the solidarity service had given as well as taken, drawn off only to replenish. she was full, she was made perfect, she was still more than merely herself. \"didn't you think it was wonderful?\" she insisted, looking into bernard's face with those supernaturally shining eyes. \"yes, i thought it was wonderful,\" he lied and looked away; the sight of her transfigured face was at once an accusation and an ironical re- minder of his own separateness. he was as miserably isolated now as he had been when the service began-more isolated by reason of his unreplenished emptiness, his dead satiety. separate and unatoned, while the others were being fused into the greater being; alone even in morgana's embrace-much more alone, indeed, more hopelessly himself than he had ever been in his life before. he had emerged from that crimson twilight into the common electric glare with a self- consciousness intensified to the pitch of agony. he was utterly miser- able, and perhaps (her shining eyes accused him), perhaps it was his own fault. \"quite wonderful,\" he repeated; but the only thing he could think of was morgana's eyebrow. chapter six odd, odd, odd, was lenina's verdict on bernard marx. so odd, in- deed, that in the course of the succeeding weeks she had wondered more than once whether she shouldn't change her mind about the new mexico holiday, and go instead to the north pole with benito hoover. the trouble was that she knew the north pole, had been there with george edzel only last summer, and what was more, found it pretty grim. nothing to do, and the hotel too hopelessly old-fashioned-no television laid on in the bedrooms, no scent organ, only the most pu- trid synthetic music, and not more than twenty-five escalator-squash courts for over two hundred guests. no, decidedly she couldn't face the north pole again. added to which, she had only been to america once before. and even then, how inadequately! a cheap week-end in new york-had it been with jean-jacques habibullah or bokanovsky jones? she couldn't remember. anyhow, it was of absolutely no impor- tance. the prospect of flying west again, and for a whole week, was very inviting. moreover, for at least three days of that week they would be in the savage reservation. not more than half a dozen people in the whole centre had ever been inside a savage reservation. as an alpha-plus psychologist, bernard was one of the few men she knew entitled to a permit. for lenina, the opportunity was unique. and yet, so unique also was bernard's oddness that she had hesitated to take it, had actually thought of risking the pole again with funny old benito. at least benito was normal. whereas bernard ... \"alcohol in his blood-surrogate,\" was fanny's explanation of every ec- centricity. but henry, with whom, one evening when they were in bed together, lenina had rather anxiously discussed her new lover, henry had compared poor bernard to a rhinoceros. \"you can't teach a rhinoceros tricks,\" he had explained in his brief and vigorous style. \"some men are almost rhinoceroses; they don't re- spond properly to conditioning. poor devils! bernard's one of them. luckily for him, he's pretty good at his job. otherwise the director would never have kept him. however,\" he added consolingly, \"i think he's pretty harmless.\" pretty harmless, perhaps; but also pretty disquieting. that mania, to start with, for doing things in private. which meant, in practice, not doing anything at all. for what was there that one could do in private. (apart, of course, from going to bed: but one couldn't do that all the time.) yes, what was there? precious little. the first afternoon they went out together was particularly fine. lenina had suggested a swim at toquay country club followed by dinner at the oxford union. but bernard thought there would be too much of a crowd. then what about a round of electro-magnetic golf at st. andrew's? but again, no: bernard considered that electro-magnetic golf was a waste of time. \"then what's time for?\" asked lenina in some astonishment. apparently, for going walks in the lake district; for that was what he now proposed. land on the top of skiddaw and walk for a couple of hours in the heather. \"alone with you, lenina.\" \"but, bernard, we shall be alone all night.\" bernard blushed and looked away. \"i meant, alone for talking,\" he mumbled. \"talking? but what about?\" walking and talking-that seemed a very odd way of spending an afternoon. in the end she persuaded him, much against his will, to fly over to amsterdam to see the semi-demi-finals of the women's heavyweight wrestling championship. \"in a crowd,\" he grumbled. \"as usual.\" he remained obstinately gloomy the whole afternoon; wouldn't talk to lenina's friends (of whom they met dozens in the ice-cream soma bar between the wres- tling bouts); and in spite of his misery absolutely refused to take the half-gramme raspberry sundae which she pressed upon him. \"i'd rather be myself,\" he said. \"myself and nasty. not somebody else, however jolly.\" \"a gramme in time saves nine,\" said lenina, producing a bright treas- ure of sleep-taught wisdom. bernard pushed away the proffered glass impatiently. \"now don't lose your temper,\" she said. \"remember one cubic centi- metre cures ten gloomy sentiments.\" \"oh, for ford's sake, be quiet!\" he shouted. lenina shrugged her shoulders. \"a gramme is always better than a damn,\" she concluded with dignity, and drank the sundae herself. on their way back across the channel, bernard insisted on stopping his propeller and hovering on his helicopter screws within a hundred feet of the waves. the weather had taken a change for the worse; a south- westerly wind had sprung up, the sky was cloudy. \"look,\" he commanded. \"but it's horrible,\" said lenina, shrinking back from the window. she was appalled by the rushing emptiness of the night, by the black foam-flecked water heaving beneath them, by the pale face of the moon, so haggard and distracted among the hastening clouds. \"let's turn on the radio. quick!\" she reached for the dialling knob on the dash-board and turned it at random. \"... skies are blue inside of you,\" sang sixteen tremoloing falsettos, \"the weather's always ...\" then a hiccough and silence. bernard had switched off the current. \"i want to look at the sea in peace,\" he said. \"one can't even look with that beastly noise going on.\" \"but it's lovely. and i don't want to look.\" \"but i do,\" he insisted. \"it makes me feel as though ...\" he hesitated, searching for words with which to express himself, \"as though i were more me, if you see what i mean. more on my own, not so completely a part of something else. not just a cell in the social body. doesn't it make you feel like that, lenina?\" but lenina was crying. \"it's horrible, it's horrible,\" she kept repeating. \"and how can you talk like that about not wanting to be a part of the social body? after all, every one works for every one else. we can't do without any one. even epsilons ...\" \"yes, i know,\" said bernard derisively. '\"even epsilons are useful'! so am i. and i damned well wish i weren't!\" lenina was shocked by his blasphemy. \"bernard!\" she protested in a voice of amazed distress. \"how can you?\" in a different key, \"how can i?\" he repeated meditatively. \"no, the real problem is: how is it that i can't, or rather-because, after all, i know quite well why i can't-what would it be like if i could, if i were free- not enslaved by my conditioning.\" \"but, bernard, you're saying the most awful things.\" \"don't you wish you were free, lenina?\" \"i don't know what you mean. i am free. free to have the most won- derful time. everybody's happy nowadays.\" he laughed, \"yes, 'everybody's happy nowadays.' we begin giving the children that at five. but wouldn't you like to be free to be happy in some other way, lenina? in your own way, for example; not in every- body else's way.\" \"i don't know what you mean,\" she repeated. then, turning to him, \"oh, do let's go back, bernard,\" she besought; \"i do so hate it here.\" \"don't you like being with me?\" \"but of course, bernard. it's this horrible place.\" \"i thought we'd be more ... more together here-with nothing but the sea and moon. more together than in that crowd, or even in my rooms. don't you understand that?\" \"i don't understand anything,\" she said with decision, determined to preserve her incomprehension intact. \"nothing. least of all,\" she con- tinued in another tone \"why you don't take soma when you have these dreadful ideas of yours. you'd forget all about them. and instead of feeling miserable, you'd be jolly. so jolly,\" she repeated and smiled, for all the puzzled anxiety in her eyes, with what was meant to be an in- viting and voluptuous cajolery. he looked at her in silence, his face unresponsive and very grave- looked at her intently. after a few seconds lenina's eyes flinched away; she uttered a nervous little laugh, tried to think of something to say and couldn't. the silence prolonged itself. when bernard spoke at last, it was in a small tired voice. \"all right then,\" he said, \"we'll go back.\" and stepping hard on the accelerator, he sent the machine rocketing up into the sky. at four thousand he started his propeller. they flew in silence for a minute or two. then, suddenly, bernard began to laugh. rather oddly, lenina thought, but still, it was laughter. \"feeling better?\" she ventured to ask. for answer, he lifted one hand from the controls and, slipping his arm around her, began to fondle her breasts. \"thank ford,\" she said to herself, \"he's all right again.\" half an hour later they were back in his rooms. bernard swallowed four tablets of soma at a gulp, turned on the radio and television and began to undress. \"well,\" lenina enquired, with significant archness when they met next afternoon on the roof, \"did you think it was fun yesterday?\" bernard nodded. they climbed into the plane. a little jolt, and they were off. \"every one says i'm awfully pneumatic,\" said lenina reflectively, pat- ting her own legs. \"awfully.\" but there was an expression of pain in bernard's eyes. \"like meat,\" he was thinking. she looked up with a certain anxiety. \"but you don't think i'm too plump, do you?\" he shook his head. like so much meat. \"you think i'm all right.\" another nod. \"in every way?\" \"perfect,\" he said aloud. and inwardly. \"she thinks of herself that way. she doesn't mind being meat.\" lenina smiled triumphantly. but her satisfaction was premature. \"all the same,\" he went on, after a little pause, \"i still rather wish it had all ended differently.\" \"differently?\" were there other endings? \"i didn't want it to end with our going to bed,\" he specified. lenina was astonished. \"not at once, not the first day.\" \"but then what ...?\" he began to talk a lot of incomprehensible and dangerous nonsense. lenina did her best to stop the ears of her mind; but every now and then a phrase would insist on becoming audible. \"... to try the effect of arresting my impulses,\" she heard him say. the words seemed to touch a spring in her mind. \"never put off till to-morrow the fun you can have to-day,\" she said gravely. \"two hundred repetitions, twice a week from fourteen to sixteen and a half,\" was all his comment. the mad bad talk rambled on. \"i want to know what passion is,\" she heard him saying. \"i want to feel some- thing strongly.\" \"when the individual feels, the community reels,\" lenina pronounced. \"well, why shouldn't it reel a bit?\" \"bernard!\" but bernard remained unabashed. \"adults intellectually and during working hours,\" he went on. \"infants where feeling and desire are concerned.\" \"our ford loved infants.\" ignoring the interruption. \"it suddenly struck me the other day,\" con- tinued bernard, \"that it might be possible to be an adult all the time.\" \"i don't understand.\" lenina's tone was firm. \"i know you don't. and that's why we went to bed together yester- day-like infants-instead of being adults and waiting.\" \"but it was fun,\" lenina insisted. \"wasn't it?\" \"oh, the greatest fun,\" he answered, but in a voice so mournful, with an expression so profoundly miserable, that lenina felt all her triumph suddenly evaporate. perhaps he had found her too plump, after all. \"i told you so,\" was all that fanny said, when lenina came and made her confidences. \"it's the alcohol they put in his surrogate.\" \"all the same,\" lenina insisted. \"i do like him. he has such awfully nice hands. and the way he moves his shoulders-that's very attractive.\" she sighed. \"but i wish he weren't so odd.\" â§2 halting for a moment outside the door of the director's room, ber- nard drew a deep breath and squared his shoulders, bracing himself to meet the dislike and disapproval which he was certain of finding within. he knocked and entered. \"a permit for you to initial, director,\" he said as airily as possible, and laid the paper on the writing-table. the director glanced at him sourly. but the stamp of the world con- troller's office was at the head of the paper and the signature of mus- tapha mond, bold and black, across the bottom. everything was per- fectly in order. the director had no choice. he pencilled his initials-two small pale letters abject at the feet of mustapha mond-and was about to return the paper without a word of comment or genial ford-speed, when his eye was caught by something written in the body of the per- mit. \"for the new mexican reservation?\" he said, and his tone, the face he lifted to bernard, expressed a kind of agitated astonishment. surprised by his surprise, bernard nodded. there was a silence. the director leaned back in his chair, frowning. \"how long ago was it?\" he said, speaking more to himself than to bernard. \"twenty years, i suppose. nearer twenty-five. i must have been your age ...\" he sighed and shook his head. bernard felt extremely uncomfortable. a man so conventional, so scru- pulously correct as the director-and to commit so gross a solecism! it made him want to hide his face, to run out of the room. not that he himself saw anything intrinsically objectionable in people talking about the remote past; that was one of those hypnopaedic prejudices he had (so he imagined) completely got rid of. what made him feel shy was the knowledge that the director disapproved-disapproved and yet had been betrayed into doing the forbidden thing. under what inward com- pulsion? through his discomfort bernard eagerly listened. \"i had the same idea as you,\" the director was saying. \"wanted to have a look at the savages. got a permit for new mexico and went there for my summer holiday. with the girl i was having at the mo- ment. she was a beta-minus, and i think\" (he shut his eyes), \"i think she had yellow hair. anyhow she was pneumatic, particularly pneu- matic; i remember that. well, we went there, and we looked at the savages, and we rode about on horses and all that. and then-it was almost the last day of my leave-then ... well, she got lost. we'd gone riding up one of those revolting mountains, and it was horribly hot and oppressive, and after lunch we went to sleep. or at least i did. she must have gone for a walk, alone. at any rate, when i woke up, she wasn't there. and the most frightful thunderstorm i've ever seen was just bursting on us. and it poured and roared and flashed; and the horses broke loose and ran away; and i fell down, trying to catch them, and hurt my knee, so that i could hardly walk. still, i searched and i shouted and i searched. but there was no sign of her. then i thought she must have gone back to the rest-house by herself. so i crawled down into the valley by the way we had come. my knee was agonizingly painful, and i'd lost my soma. it took me hours. i didn't get back to the rest-house till after midnight. and she wasn't there; she wasn't there,\" the director repeated. there was a silence. \"well,\" he resumed at last, \"the next day there was a search. but we couldn't find her. she must have fallen into a gully somewhere; or been eaten by a mountain lion. ford knows. anyhow it was horrible. it upset me very much at the time. more than it ought to have done, i dare say. because, after all, it's the sort of accident that might have happened to any one; and, of course, the social body persists although the com- ponent cells may change.\" but this sleep-taught consolation did not seem to be very effective. shaking his head, \"i actually dream about it sometimes,\" the director went on in a low voice. \"dream of being woken up by that peal of thunder and finding her gone; dream of searching and searching for her under the trees.\" he lapsed into the silence of reminiscence. \"you must have had a terrible shock,\" said bernard, almost enviously. at the sound of his voice the director started into a guilty realization of where he was; shot a glance at bernard, and averting his eyes, blushed darkly; looked at him again with sudden suspicion and, angrily on his dignity, \"don't imagine,\" he said, \"that i'd had any indecorous relation with the girl. nothing emotional, nothing long-drawn. it was all perfectly healthy and normal.\" he handed bernard the permit. \"i really don't know why i bored you with this trivial anecdote.\" furious with himself for having given away a discreditable secret, he vented his rage on bernard. the look in his eyes was now frankly malignant. \"and i should like to take this opportunity, mr. marx,\" he went on, \"of saying that i'm not at all pleased with the reports i receive of your behaviour outside working hours. you may say that this is not my business. but it is. i have the good name of the centre to think of. my workers must be above suspicion, particularly those of the highest castes. alphas are so conditioned that they do not have to be infantile in their emotional behaviour. but that is all the more reason for their making a special ef- fort to conform. it is their duty to be infantile, even against their incli- nation. and so, mr. marx, i give you fair warning.\" the director's voice vibrated with an indignation that had now become wholly righteous and impersonal-was the expression of the disapproval of society itself. \"if ever i hear again of any lapse from a proper standard of infantile decorum, i shall ask for your transference to a sub-centre-preferably to iceland. good morning.\" and swivelling round in his chair, he picked up his pen and began to write. \"that'll teach him,\" he said to himself. but he was mistaken. for ber- nard left the room with a swagger, exulting, as he banged the door behind him, in the thought that he stood alone, embattled against the order of things; elated by the intoxicating consciousness of his individ- ual significance and importance. even the thought of persecution left him undismayed, was rather tonic than depressing. he felt strong enough to meet and overcome affliction, strong enough to face even iceland. and this confidence was the greater for his not for a moment really believing that he would be called upon to face anything at all. people simply weren't transferred for things like that. iceland was just a threat. a most stimulating and life-giving threat. walking along the corridor, he actually whistled. heroic was the account he gave that evening of his interview with the d.h.c. \"whereupon,\" it concluded, \"i simply told him to go to the bot- tomless past and marched out of the room. and that was that.\" he looked at helmholtz watson expectantly, awaiting his due reward of sympathy, encouragement, admiration. but no word came. helmholtz sat silent, staring at the floor. he liked bernard; he was grateful to him for being the only man of his acquaintance with whom he could talk about the subjects he felt to be important. nevertheless, there were things in bernard which he hated. this boasting, for example. and the outbursts of an abject self-pity with which it alternated. and his deplorable habit of being bold after the event, and full, in absence, of the most extraordinary presence of mind. he hated these things-just because he liked bernard. the sec- onds passed. helmholtz continued to stare at the floor. and suddenly bernard blushed and turned away. â§3 the journey was quite uneventful. the blue pacific rocket was two and a half minutes early at new orleans, lost four minutes in a tornado over texas, but flew into a favourable air current at longitude 95 west, and was able to land at santa fe less than forty seconds behind schedule time. \"forty seconds on a six and a half hour flight. not so bad,\" lenina con- ceded. they slept that night at santa fe. the hotel was excellent-incompara- bly better, for example, than that horrible aurora bora palace in which lenina had suffered so much the previous summer. liquid air, televi- sion, vibro-vacuum massage, radio, boiling caffeine solution, hot con- traceptives, and eight different kinds of scent were laid on in every bedroom. the synthetic music plant was working as they entered the hall and left nothing to be desired. a notice in the lift announced that there were sixty escalator-squash-racket courts in the hotel, and that obstacle and electro-magnetic golf could both be played in the park. \"but it sounds simply too lovely,\" cried lenina. \"i almost wish we could stay here. sixty escalator-squash courts ...\" \"there won't be any in the reservation,\" bernard warned her. \"and no scent, no television, no hot water even. if you feel you can't stand it, stay here till i come back.\" lenina was quite offended. \"of course i can stand it. i only said it was lovely here because ... well, because progress is lovely, isn't it?\" \"five hundred repetitions once a week from thirteen to seventeen,\" said bernard wearily, as though to himself. \"what did you say?\" \"i said that progress was lovely. that's why you mustn't come to the reservation unless you really want to.\" \"but i do want to.\" \"very well, then,\" said bernard; and it was almost a threat. their permit required the signature of the warden of the reservation, at whose office next morning they duly presented themselves. an epsilon-plus negro porter took in bernard's card, and they were admit- ted almost immediately. the warden was a blond and brachycephalic alpha-minus, short, red, moon-faced, and broad-shouldered, with a loud booming voice, very well adapted to the utterance of hypnopaedic wisdom. he was a mine of irrelevant information and unasked-for good advice. once started, he went on and on-boomingly. \"... five hundred and sixty thousand square kilometres, divided into four distinct sub-reservations, each surrounded by a high-tension wire fence.\" at this moment, and for no apparent reason, bernard suddenly re- membered that he had left the eau de cologne tap in his bathroom wide open and running. \"... supplied with current from the grand canyon hydro-electric sta- tion.\" \"cost me a fortune by the time i get back.\" with his mind's eye, ber- nard saw the needle on the scent meter creeping round and round, antlike, indefatigable. \"quickly telephone to helmholtz watson.\" \"... upwards of five thousand kilometres of fencing at sixty thousand volts.\" \"you don't say so,\" said lenina politely, not knowing in the least what the warden had said, but taking her cue from his dramatic pause. when the warden started booming, she had inconspicuously swallowed half a gramme of soma, with the result that she could now sit, se- renely not listening, thinking of nothing at all, but with her large blue eyes fixed on the warden's face in an expression of rapt attention. \"to touch the fence is instant death,\" pronounced the warden sol- emnly. \"there is no escape from a savage reservation.\" the word \"escape\" was suggestive. \"perhaps,\" said bernard, half ris- ing, \"we ought to think of going.\" the little black needle was scurrying, an insect, nibbling through time, eating into his money. \"no escape,\" repeated the warden, waving him back into his chair; and as the permit was not yet countersigned bernard had no choice but to obey. \"those who are born in the reservation-and remember, my dear young lady,\" he added, leering obscenely at lenina, and speaking in an improper whisper, \"remember that, in the reservation, children still are born, yes, actually born, revolting as that may seem ...\" (he hoped that this reference to a shameful subject would make lenina blush; but she only smiled with simulated intelligence and said, \"you don't say so!\" disappointed, the warden began again. ) \"those, i repeat who are born in the reservation are destined to die there.\" destined to die ... a decilitre of eau de cologne every minute. six litres an hour. \"perhaps,\" bernard tried again, \"we ought ...\" leaning forward, the warden tapped the table with his forefinger. \"you ask me how many people live in the reservation. and i reply\"-trium- phantly-\"i reply that we do not know. we can only guess.\" \"you don't say so.\" \"my dear young lady, i do say so.\" six times twenty-four-no, it would be nearer six times thirty-six. ber- nard was pale and trembling with impatience. but inexorably the booming continued. \"... about sixty thousand indians and half-breeds ... absolute savages ... our inspectors occasionally visit ... otherwise, no communication what- ever with the civilized world ... still preserve their repulsive habits and customs ... marriage, if you know what that is, my dear young lady; families ... no conditioning ... monstrous superstitions ... christianity and totemism and ancestor worship ... extinct languages, such as zuni and spanish and athapascan ... pumas, porcupines and other ferocious animals ... infectious diseases ... priests ... venomous lizards ...\" \"you don't say so?\" they got away at last. bernard dashed to the telephone. quick, quick; but it took him nearly three minutes to get on to helmholtz watson. \"we might be among the savages already,\" he complained. \"damned incompetence!\" \"have a gramme,\" suggested lenina. he refused, preferring his anger. and at last, thank ford, he was through and, yes, it was helmholtz; helmholtz, to whom he explained what had happened, and who promised to go round at once, at once, and turn off the tap, yes, at once, but took this opportunity to tell him what the d.h.c. had said, in public, yesterday evening ... \"what? he's looking out for some one to take my place?\" bernard's voice was agonized. \"so it's actually decided? did he mention iceland? you say he did? ford! iceland ...\" he hung up the receiver and turned back to lenina. his face was pale, his expression utterly dejected. \"what's the matter?\" she asked. \"the matter?\" he dropped heavily into a chair. \"i'm going to be sent to iceland.\" often in the past he had wondered what it would be like to be sub- jected (soma-less and with nothing but his own inward resources to rely on) to some great trial, some pain, some persecution; he had even longed for affliction. as recently as a week ago, in the director's office, he had imagined himself courageously resisting, stoically ac- cepting suffering without a word. the director's threats had actually elated him, made him feel larger than life. but that, as he now real- ized, was because he had not taken the threats quite seriously, he had not believed that, when it came to the point, the d.h.c. would ever do anything. now that it looked as though the threats were really to be fulfilled, bernard was appalled. of that imagined stoicism, that theo- retical courage, not a trace was left. he raged against himself-what a fooll-against the director-how unfair not to give him that other chance, that other chance which, he now had no doubt at all, he had always intended to take. and iceland, ice- land ... lenina shook her head. \"was and will make me ill,\" she quoted, \"i take a gramme and only am.\" in the end she persuaded him to swallow four tablets of soma. five minutes later roots and fruits were abolished; the flower of the present rosily blossomed. a message from the porter announced that, at the warden's orders, a reservation guard had come round with a plane and was waiting on the roof of the hotel. they went up at once. an oc- toroon in gamma-green uniform saluted and proceeded to recite the morning's programme. a bird's-eye view of ten or a dozen of the principal pueblos, then a landing for lunch in the valley of malpais. the rest-house was comfort- able there, and up at the pueblo the savages would probably be cele- brating their summer festival. it would be the best place to spend the night. they took their seats in the plane and set off. ten minutes later they were crossing the frontier that separated civilization from savagery. uphill and down, across the deserts of salt or sand, through forests, into the violet depth of canyons, over crag and peak and table-topped mesa, the fence marched on and on, irresistibly the straight line, the geometrical symbol of triumphant human purpose. and at its foot, here and there, a mosaic of white bones, a still unrotted carcase dark on the tawny ground marked the place where deer or steer, puma or porcupine or coyote, or the greedy turkey buzzards drawn down by the whiff of carrion and fulminated as though by a poetic justice, had come too close to the destroying wires. \"they never learn,\" said the green-uniformed pilot, pointing down at the skeletons on the ground below them. \"and they never will learn,\" he added and laughed, as though he had somehow scored a personal triumph over the electrocuted animals. bernard also laughed; after two grammes of soma the joke seemed, for some reason, good. laughed and then, almost immediately, dropped off to sleep, and sleeping was carried over taos and tesuque; over nambe and picuris and pojoaque, over sia and cochiti, over la- guna and acoma and the enchanted mesa, over zuhi and cibola and ojo caliente, and woke at last to find the machine standing on the ground, lenina carrying the suit-cases into a small square house, and the gam ma -green octoroon talking incomprehensibly with a young in- dian. \"malpais,\" explained the pilot, as bernard stepped out. \"this is the rest-house. and there's a dance this afternoon at the pueblo. he'll take you there.\" he pointed to the sullen young savage. \"funny, i expect.\" he grinned. \"everything they do is funny.\" and with that he climbed into the plane and started up the engines. \"back to-morrow. and re- member,\" he added reassuringly to lenina, \"they're perfectly tame; savages won't do you any harm. they've got enough experience of gas bombs to know that they mustn't play any tricks.\" still laughing, he threw the helicopter screws into gear, accelerated, and was gone. chapter seven the mesa was like a ship becalmed in a strait of lion-coloured dust. the channel wound between precipitous banks, and slanting from one wall to the other across the valley ran a streak of green-the river and its fields. on the prow of that stone ship in the centre of the strait, and seemingly a part of it, a shaped and geometrical outcrop of the naked rock, stood the pueblo of malpais. block above block, each story smaller than the one below, the tall houses rose like stepped and am- putated pyramids into the blue sky. at their feet lay a straggle of low buildings, a criss-cross of walls; and on three sides the precipices fell sheer into the plain. a few columns of smoke mounted perpendicularly into the windless air and were lost. \"queer,\" said lenina. \"very queer.\" it was her ordinary word of con- demnation. \"i don't like it. and i don't like that man.\" she pointed to the indian guide who had been appointed to take them up to the pueblo. her feeling was evidently reciprocated; the very back of the man, as he walked along before them, was hostile, sullenly contemp- tuous. \"besides,\" she lowered her voice, \"he smells.\" bernard did not attempt to deny it. they walked on. suddenly it was as though the whole air had come alive and were pulsing, pulsing with the indefatigable movement of blood. up there, in malpais, the drums were being beaten. their feet fell in with the rhythm of that mysterious heart; they quickened their pace. their path led them to the foot of the precipice. the sides of the great mesa ship towered over them, three hundred feet to the gunwale. \"i wish we could have brought the plane,\" said lenina, looking up re- sentfully at the blank impending rock-face. \"i hate walking. and you feel so small when you're on the ground at the bottom of a hill.\" they walked along for some way in the shadow of the mesa, rounded a projection, and there, in a water-worn ravine, was the way up the companion ladder. they climbed. it was a very steep path that zig- zagged from side to side of the gully. sometimes the pulsing of the drums was all but inaudible, at others they seemed to be beating only just round the corner. when they were half-way up, an eagle flew past so close to them that the wind of his wings blew chill on their faces. in a crevice of the rock lay a pile of bones. it was all oppressively queer, and the indian smelt stronger and stronger. they emerged at last from the ravine into the full sunlight. the top of the mesa was a flat deck of stone. \"like the charing-t tower,\" was lenina's comment. but she was not al- lowed to enjoy her discovery of this reassuring resemblance for long. a padding of soft feet made them turn round. naked from throat to na- vel, their dark brown bodies painted with white lines (\"like asphalt tennis courts,\" lenina was later to explain), their faces inhuman with daubings of scarlet, black and ochre, two indians came running along the path. their black hair was braided with fox fur and red flannel. cloaks of turkey feathers fluttered from their shoulders; huge feather diadems exploded gaudily round their heads. with every step they took came the clink and rattle of their silver bracelets, their heavy necklaces of bone and turquoise beads. they came on without a word, running quietly in their deerskin moccasins. one of them was holding a feather brush; the other carried, in either hand, what looked at a dis- tance like three or four pieces of thick rope. one of the ropes writhed uneasily, and suddenly lenina saw that they were snakes. the men came nearer and nearer; their dark eyes looked at her, but without giving any sign of recognition, any smallest sign that they had seen her or were aware of her existence. the writhing snake hung limp again with the rest. the men passed. \"i don't like it,\" said lenina. \"i don't like it.\" she liked even less what awaited her at the entrance to the pueblo, where their guide had left them while he went inside for instructions. the dirt, to start with, the piles of rubbish, the dust, the dogs, the flies. her face wrinkled up into a grimace of disgust. she held her handkerchief to her nose. \"but how can they live like this?\" she broke out in a voice of indignant incredulity. (it wasn't possible.) bernard shrugged his shoulders philosophically. \"anyhow,\" he said, \"they've been doing it for the last five or six thousand years. so i sup- pose they must be used to it by now.\" \"but cleanliness is next to fordliness,\" she insisted. \"yes, and civilization is sterilization,\" bernard went on, concluding on a tone of irony the second hypnopaedic lesson in elementary hygiene. \"but these people have never heard of our ford, and they aren't civi- lized. so there's no point in ...\" \"oh!\" she gripped his arm. \"look.\" an almost naked indian was very slowly climbing down the ladder from the first-floor terrace of a neighboring house-rung after rung, with the tremulous caution of extreme old age. his face was profoundly wrin- kled and black, like a mask of obsidian. the toothless mouth had fallen in. at the corners of the lips, and on each side of the chin, a few long bristles gleamed almost white against the dark skin. the long un- braided hair hung down in grey wisps round his face. his body was bent and emaciated to the bone, almost fleshless. very slowly he came down, pausing at each rung before he ventured another step. \"what's the matter with him?\" whispered lenina. her eyes were wide with horror and amazement. \"he's old, that's all,\" bernard answered as carelessly as he could. he too was startled; but he made an effort to seem unmoved. \"old?\" she repeated. \"but the director's old; lots of people are old; they're not like that.\" \"that's because we don't allow them to be like that. we preserve them from diseases. we keep their internal secretions artificially balanced at a youthful equilibrium. we don't permit their magnesium-calcium ratio to fall below what it was at thirty. we give them transfusion of young blood. we keep their metabolism permanently stimulated. so, of course, they don't look like that. partly,\" he added, \"because most of them die long before they reach this old creature's age. youth almost unimpaired till sixty, and then, crack! the end.\" but lenina was not listening. she was watching the old man. slowly, slowly he came down. his feet touched the ground. he turned. in their deep-sunken orbits his eyes were still extraordinarily bright. they looked at her for a long moment expressionlessly, without surprise, as though she had not been there at all. then slowly, with bent back the old man hobbled past them and was gone. \"but it's terrible,\" lenina whispered. \"it's awful. we ought not to have come here.\" she felt in her pocket for her soma-only to discover that, by some unprecedented oversight, she had left the bottle down at the rest-house. bernard's pockets were also empty. lenina was left to face the horrors of malpais unaided. they came crowding in on her thick and fast. the spectacle of two young women giving breast to their babies made her blush and turn away her face. she had never seen anything so indecent in her life. and what made it worse was that, instead of tactfully ignoring it, bernard proceeded to make open comments on this revoltingly viviparous scene. ashamed, now that the effects of the soma had worn off, of the weakness he had displayed that morning in the hotel, he went out of his way to show himself strong and unorthodox. \"what a wonderfully intimate relationship,\" he said, deliberately outra- geous. \"and what an intensity of feeling it must generate! i often think one may have missed something in not having had a mother. and per- haps you've missed something in not being a mother, lenina. imagine yourself sitting there with a little baby of your own. ...\" \"bernard! how can you?\" the passage of an old woman with oph- thalmia and a disease of the skin distracted her from her indignation. \"let's go away,\" she begged. \"i don't like it.\" but at this moment their guide came back and, beckoning them to fol- low, led the way down the narrow street between the houses. they rounded a corner. a dead dog was lying on a rubbish heap; a woman with a goitre was looking for lice in the hair of a small girl. their guide halted at the foot of a ladder, raised his hand perpendicularly, then darted it horizontally forward. they did what he mutely command- ed-climbed the ladder and walked through the doorway, to which it gave access, into a long narrow room, rather dark and smelling of smoke and cooked grease and long-worn, long-unwashed clothes. at the further end of the room was another doorway, through which came a shaft of sunlight and the noise, very loud and close, of the drums. they stepped across the threshold and found themselves on a wide terrace. below them, shut in by the tall houses, was the village square, crowded with indians. bright blankets, and feathers in black hair, and the glint of turquoise, and dark skins shining with heat. lenina put her handkerchief to her nose again. in the open space at the centre of the square were two circular platforms of masonry and trampled clay-the roofs, it was evident, of underground chambers; for in the centre of each platform was an open hatchway, with a ladder emerging from the lower darkness. a sound of subterranean flute playing came up and was almost lost in the steady remorseless persistence of the drums. lenina liked the drums. shutting her eyes she abandoned herself to their soft repeated thunder, allowed it to invade her consciousness more and more completely, till at last there was nothing left in the world but that one deep pulse of sound. it reminded her reassuringly of the synthetic noises made at solidarity services and ford's day celebrations. \"orgy-porgy,\" she whispered to herself. these drums beat out just the same rhythms. there was a sudden startling burst of singing-hundreds of male voices crying out fiercely in harsh metallic unison. a few long notes and si- lence, the thunderous silence of the drums; then shrill, in a neighing treble, the women's answer. then again the drums; and once more the men's deep savage affirmation of their manhood. queer-yes. the place was queer, so was the music, so were the clothes and the goitres and the skin diseases and the old people. but the performance itself-there seemed to be nothing specially queer about that. \"it reminds me of a lower-caste community sing,\" she told bernard. but a little later it was reminding her a good deal less of that innocu- ous function. for suddenly there had swarmed up from those round chambers underground a ghastly troop of monsters. hideously masked or painted out of all semblance of humanity, they had tramped out a strange limping dance round the square; round and again round, sing- ing as they went, round and round-each time a little faster; and the drums had changed and quickened their rhythm, so that it became like the pulsing of fever in the ears; and the crowd had begun to sing with the dancers, louder and louder; and first one woman had shrieked, and then another and another, as though they were being killed; and then suddenly the leader of the dancers broke out of the line, ran to a big wooden chest which was standing at one end of the square, raised the lid and pulled out a pair of black snakes. a great yell went up from the crowd, and all the other dancers ran towards him with out- stretched hands. he tossed the snakes to the first-comers, then dipped back into the chest for more. more and more, black snakes and brown and mottled-he flung them out. and then the dance began again on a different rhythm. round and round they went with their snakes, snak- ily, with a soft undulating movement at the knees and hips. round and round. then the leader gave a signal, and one after another, all the snakes were flung down in the middle of the square; an old man came up from underground and sprinkled them with corn meal, and from the other hatchway came a woman and sprinkled them with water from a black jar. then the old man lifted his hand and, startlingly, terrifyingly, there was absolute silence. the drums stopped beating, life seemed to have come to an end. the old man pointed towards the two hatchways that gave entrance to the lower world. and slowly, raised by invisible hands from below, there emerged from the one a painted image of an eagle, from the other that of a man, naked, and nailed to a cross. they hung there, seemingly self-sustained, as though watching. the old man clapped his hands. naked but for a white cotton breech-cloth, a boy of about eighteen stepped out of the crowd and stood before him, his hands crossed over his chest, his head bowed. the old man made the sign of the cross over him and turned away. slowly, the boy began to walk round the writhing heap of snakes. he had completed the first circuit and was half-way through the second when, from among the dancers, a tall man wearing the mask of a coyote and hold- ing in his hand a whip of plaited leather, advanced towards him. the boy moved on as though unaware of the other's existence. the coyote- man raised his whip, there was a long moment of expectancy, then a swift movement, the whistle of the lash and its loud flat-sounding im- pact on the flesh. the boy's body quivered; but he made no sound, he walked on at the same slow, steady pace. the coyote struck again, again; and at every blow at first a gasp, and then a deep groan went up from the crowd. the boy walked. twice, thrice, four times round he went. the blood was streaming. five times round, six times round. suddenly lenina covered her face shish her hands and began to sob. \"oh, stop them, stop them!\" she implored. but the whip fell and fell inexorably. seven times round. then all at once the boy staggered and, still without a sound, pitched forward on to his face. bending over him, the old man touched his back with a long white feather, held it up for a moment, crimson, for the people to see then shook it thrice over the snakes. a few drops fell, and suddenly the drums broke out again into a panic of hurrying notes; there was a great shout. the dancers rushed forward, picked up the snakes and ran out of the square. men, women, children, all the crowd ran after them. a minute later the square was empty, only the boy remained, prone where he had fallen, quite still. three old women came out of one of the houses, and with some difficulty lifted him and carried him in. the eagle and the man on the cross kept guard for a little while over the empty pueblo; then, as though they had seen enough, sank slowly down through their hatch- ways, out of sight, into the nether world. lenina was still sobbing. \"too awful,\" she kept repeating, and all ber- nard's consolations were in vain. \"too awful! that blood!\" she shud- dered. \"oh, i wish i had my soma.\" there was the sound of feet in the inner room. lenina did not move, but sat with her face in her hands, unseeing, apart. only bernard turned round. the dress of the young man who now stepped out on to the terrace was indian; but his plaited hair was straw-coloured, his eyes a pale blue, and his skin a white skin, bronzed. \"hullo. good-morrow,\" said the stranger, in faultless but peculiar eng- lish. \"you're civilized, aren't you? you come from the other place, out- side the reservation?\" \"who on earth ... ?\" bernard began in astonishment. the young man sighed and shook his head. \"a most unhappy gentle- man.\" and, pointing to the bloodstains in the centre of the square, \"do you see that damned spot?\" he asked in a voice that trembled with emotion. \"a gramme is better than a damn,\" said lenina mechanically from be- hind her hands. \"i wish i had my soma\\\" \"i ought to have been there,\" the young man went on. \"why wouldn't they let me be the sacrifice? i'd have gone round ten times-twelve, fif- teen. palowhtiwa only got as far as seven. they could have had twice as much blood from me. the multitudinous seas incarnadine.\" he flung out his arms in a lavish gesture; then, despairingly, let them fall again. \"but they wouldn't let me. they disliked me for my complexion. it's always been like that. always.\" tears stood in the young man's eyes; he was ashamed and turned away. astonishment made lenina forget the deprivation of soma. she uncov- ered her face and, for the first time, looked at the stranger. \"do you mean to say that you wanted to be hit with that whip?\" still averted from her, the young man made a sign of affirmation. \"for the sake of the pueblo-to make the rain come and the corn grow. and to please pookong and jesus. and then to show that i can bear pain without crying out. yes,\" and his voice suddenly took on a new reso- nance, he turned with a proud squaring of the shoulders, a proud, de- fiant lifting of the chin \"to show that i'm a man ... oh!\" he gave a gasp and was silent, gaping. he had seen, for the first time in his life, the face of a girl whose cheeks were not the colour of chocolate or dog- skin, whose hair was auburn and permanently waved, and whose ex- pression (amazing novelty!) was one of benevolent interest. lenina was smiling at him; such a nice-looking boy, she was thinking, and a really beautiful body. the blood rushed up into the young man's face; he dropped his eyes, raised them again for a moment only to find her still smiling at him, and was so much overcome that he had to turn away and pretend to be looking very hard at something on the other side of the square. bernard's questions made a diversion. who? how? when? from where? keeping his eyes fixed on bernard's face (for so passionately did he long to see lenina smiling that he simply dared not look at her), the young man tried to explain himself. linda and he-linda was his mother (the word made lenina look uncomfortable)-were strangers in the reservation. linda had come from the other place long ago, before he was born, with a man who was his father. (bernard pricked up his ears.) she had gone walking alone in those mountains over there to the north, had fallen down a steep place and hurt her head. (\"go on, go on,\" said bernard excitedly.) some hunters from malpais had found her and brought her to the pueblo. as for the man who was his father, linda had never seen him again. his name was tomakin. (yes, \"tho- mas\" was the d.h.c.'s first name.) he must have flown away, back to the other place, away without her-a bad, unkind, unnatural man. \"and so i was born in malpais,\" he concluded. \"in malpais.\" and he shook his head. the squalor of that little house on the outskirts of the pueblo! a space of dust and rubbish separated it from the village. two famine- stricken dogs were nosing obscenely in the garbage at its door. inside, when they entered, the twilight stank and was loud with flies. \"linda!\" the young man called. from the inner room a rather hoarse female voice said, \"coming.\" they waited. in bowls on the floor were the remains of a meal, per- haps of several meals. the door opened. a very stout blonde squaw stepped across the threshold and stood looking at the strangers staring incredulously, her mouth open. lenina noticed with disgust that two of the front teeth were missing. and the colour of the ones that remained ... she shud- dered. it was worse than the old man. so fat. and all the lines in her face, the flabbiness, the wrinkles. and the sagging cheeks, with those purplish blotches. and the red veins on her nose, the bloodshot eyes. and that neck-that neck; and the blanket she wore over her head- ragged and filthy. and under the brown sack-shaped tunic those enor- mous breasts, the bulge of the stomach, the hips. oh, much worse than the old man, much worse! and suddenly the creature burst out in a torrent of speech, rushed at her with outstretched arms and-ford! ford! it was too revolting, in another moment she'd be sick-pressed her against the bulge, the bosom, and began to kiss her. ford! to kiss, slobberingly, and smelt too horrible, obviously never had a bath, and simply reeked of that beastly stuff that was put into delta and epsilon bottles (no, it wasn't true about bernard), positively stank of alcohol. she broke away as quickly as she could. a blubbered and distorted face confronted her; the creature was cry- ing. \"oh, my dear, my dear.\" the torrent of words flowed sobbingly. \"if you knew how glad-after all these years! a civilized face. yes, and civilized clothes. because i thought i should never see a piece of real acetate silk again.\" she fingered the sleeve of lenina's shirt. the nails were black. \"and those adorable viscose velveteen shorts! do you know, dear, i've still got my old clothes, the ones i came in, put away in a box. i'll show them you afterwards. though, of course, the acetate has all gone into holes. but such a lovely white bandolier-though i must say your green morocco is even lovelier. not that it did me much good, that bandolier.\" her tears began to flow again. \"i suppose john told you. what i had to suffer-and not a gramme of soma to be had. only a drink of mescal every now and then, when pope used to bring it. pope is a boy i used to know. but it makes you feel so bad afterwards, the mescal does, and you're sick with the peyotl; besides it always made that awful feeling of being ashamed much worse the next day. and i was so ashamed. just think of it: me, a beta-having a baby: put yourself in my place.\" (the mere suggestion made lenina shudder.) \"though it wasn't my fault, i swear; because i still don't know how it happened, seeing that i did all the malthusian drill-you know, by numbers, one, two, three, four, always, i swear it; but all the same it happened, and of course there wasn't anything like an abortion centre here. is it still down in chelsea, by the way?\" she asked. lenina nod- ded. \"and still floodlighted on tuesdays and fridays?\" lenina nodded again. \"that lovely pink glass tower!\" poor linda lifted her face and with closed eyes ecstatically contemplated the bright remembered im- age. \"and the river at night,\" she whispered. great tears oozed slowly out from behind her tight-shut eyelids. \"and flying back in the evening from stoke poges. and then a hot bath and vibro-vacuum massage ... but there.\" she drew a deep breath, shook her head, opened her eyes again, sniffed once or twice, then blew her nose on her fingers and wiped them on the skirt of her tunic. \"oh, i'm so sorry,\" she said in re- sponse to lenina's involuntary grimace of disgust. \"i oughtn't to have done that. i'm sorry. but what are you to do when there aren't any handkerchiefs? i remember how it used to upset me, all that dirt, and nothing being aseptic. i had an awful cut on my head when they first brought me here. you can't imagine what they used to put on it. filth, just filth. 'civilization is sterilization,' i used to say t them. and 'streptocock-gee to banbury-t, to see a fine bathroom and w.c.' as though they were children. but of course they didn't understand. how should they? and in the end i suppose i got used to it. and anyhow, how can you keep things clean when there isn't hot water laid on? and look at these clothes. this beastly wool isn't like acetate. it lasts and lasts. and you're supposed to mend it if it gets torn. but i'm a beta; i worked in the fertilizing room; nobody ever taught me to do anything like that. it wasn't my business. besides, it never used to be right to mend clothes. throw them away when they've got holes in them and buy new. 'the more stitches, the less riches.' isn't that right? mend- ing's anti-social. but it's all different here. it's like living with lunatics. everything they do is mad.\" she looked round; saw john and bernard had left them and were walking up and down in the dust and garbage outside the house; but, none the less confidentially lowering her voice, and leaning, while lenina stiffened and shrank, so close that the blown reek of embryo-poison stirred the hair on her cheek. \"for instance,\" she hoarsely whispered, \"take the way they have one another here. mad, i tell you, absolutely mad. everybody belongs to every one el- se-don't they? don't they?\" she insisted, tugging at lenina's sleeve. lenina nodded her averted head, let out the breath she had been hold- ing and managed to draw another one, relatively untainted. \"well, here,\" the other went on, \"nobody's supposed to belong to more than one person. and if you have people in the ordinary way, the others think you're wicked and anti-social. they hate and despise you. once a lot of women came and made a scene because their men came to see me. well, why not? and then they rushed at me ... no, it was too aw- ful. i can't tell you about it.\" linda covered her face with her hands and shuddered. \"they're so hateful, the women here. mad, mad and cruel. and of course they don't know anything about malthusian drill, or bottles, or decanting, or anything of that sort. so they're having children all the time-like dogs. it's too revolting. and to think that i ... oh, ford, ford, ford! and yet john was a great comfort to me. i don't know what i should have done without him. even though he did get so upset whenever a man ... quite as a tiny boy, even. once (but that was when he was bigger) he tried to kill poor waihusiwa-or was it pope?- just because i used to have them sometimes. because i never could make him understand that that was what civilized people ought to do. being mad's infectious i believe. anyhow, john seems to have caught it from the indians. because, of course, he was with them a lot. even though they always were so beastly to him and wouldn't let him do all the things the other boys did. which was a good thing in a way, be- cause it made it easier for me to condition him a little. though you've no idea how difficult that is. there's so much one doesn't know; it wasn't my business to know. i mean, when a child asks you how a helicopter works or who made the world-well, what are you to answer if you're a beta and have always worked in the fertilizing room? what are you to answer?\" chapter eight outside, in the dust and among the garbage (there were four dogs now), bernard and john were walking slowly up and down. \"so hard for me to realize,\" bernard was saying, \"to reconstruct. as though we were living on different planets, in different centuries. a mother, and all this dirt, and gods, and old age, and disease ...\" he shook his head. \"it's almost inconceivable. i shall never understand, unless you explain.\" \"explain what?\" \"this.\" he indicated the pueblo. \"that.\" and it was the little house out- side the village. \"everything. all your life.\" \"but what is there to say?\" \"from the beginning. as far back as you can remember.\" \"as far back as i can remember.\" john frowned. there was a long si- lence. it was very hot. they had eaten a lot of tortillas and sweet corn. linda said, \"come and lie down, baby.\" they lay down together in the big bed. \"sing,\" and linda sang. sang \"streptocock-gee to banbury-t\" and \"bye baby banting, soon you'll need decanting.\" her voice got fainter and fainter ... there was a loud noise, and he woke with a start. a man was saying something to linda, and linda was laughing. she had pulled the blan- ket up to her chin, but the man pulled it down again. his hair was like two black ropes, and round his arm was a lovely silver bracelet with blue stones in it. he liked the bracelet; but all the same, he was fright- ened; he hid his face against linda's body. linda put her hand on him and he felt safer. in those other words he did not understand so well, she said to the man, \"not with john here.\" the man looked at him, then again at linda, and said a few words in a soft voice. linda said, \"no.\" but the man bent over the bed towards him and his face was huge, terrible; the black ropes of hair touched the blanket. \"no,\" linda said again, and he felt her hand squeezing him more tightly. \"no, no!\" but the man took hold of one of his arms, and it hurt. he screamed. the man put up his other hand and lifted him up. linda was still hold- ing him, still saying, \"no, no.\" the man said something short and an- gry, and suddenly her hands were gone. \"linda, linda.\" he kicked and wriggled; but the man carried him across to the door, opened it, put him down on the floor in the middle of the other room, and went away, shutting the door behind him. he got up, he ran to the door. standing on tiptoe he could just reach the big wooden latch. he lifted it and pushed; but the door wouldn't open. \"linda,\" he shouted. she didn't answer. he remembered a huge room, rather dark; and there were big wooden things with strings fastened to them, and lots of women standing round them-making blankets, linda said. linda told him to sit in the corner with the other children, while she went and helped the women. he played with the little boys for a long time. suddenly people started talking very loud, and there were the women pushing linda away, and linda was crying. she went to the door and he ran after her. he asked her why they were angry. \"because i broke something,\" she said. and then she got angry too. \"how should i know how to do their beastly weaving?\" she said. \"beastly savages.\" he asked her what savages were. when they got back to their house, pope was waiting at the door, and he came in with them. he had a big gourd full of stuff that looked like water; only it wasn't water, but something with a bad smell that burnt your mouth and made you cough. linda drank some and pope drank some, and then linda laughed a lot and talked very loud; and then she and pope went into the other room. when pope went away, he went into the room. linda was in bed and so fast asleep that he couldn't wake her. pope used to come often. he said the stuff in the gourd was called mescal; but linda said it ought to be called soma; only it made you feel ill afterwards. he hated pope. he hated them all-all the men who came to see linda. one afternoon, when he had been playing with the other children-it was cold, he remembered, and there was snow on the mountains-he came back to the house and heard angry voices in the bedroom. they were women's voices, and they said words he didn't understand, but he knew they were dreadful words. then sud- denly, crash! something was upset; he heard people moving about quickly, and there was another crash and then a noise like hitting a mule, only not so bony; then linda screamed. \"oh, don't, don't, don't!\" she said. he ran in. there were three women in dark blankets. linda was on the bed. one of the women was holding her wrists. an- other was lying across her legs, so that she couldn't kick. the third was hitting her with a whip. once, twice, three times; and each time linda screamed. crying, he tugged at the fringe of the woman's blan- ket. \"please, please.\" with her free hand she held him away. the whip came down again, and again linda screamed. he caught hold of the woman's enormous brown hand between his own and bit it with all his might. she cried out, wrenched her hand free, and gave him such a push that he fell down. while he was lying on the ground she hit him three times with the whip. it hurt more than anything he had ever felt-like fire. the whip whistled again, fell. but this time it was linda who screamed. \"but why did they want to hurt you, linda?\" he asked that night. he was crying, because the red marks of the whip on his back still hurt so terribly. but he was also crying because people were so beastly and unfair, and because he was only a little boy and couldn't do anything against them. linda was crying too. she was grown up, but she wasn't big enough to fight against three of them. it wasn't fair for her either. \"why did they want to hurt you, linda?\" \"i don't know. how should i know?\" it was difficult to hear what she said, because she was lying on her stomach and her face was in the pillow. \"they say those men are their men,\" she went on; and she did not seem to be talking to him at all; she seemed to be talking with some one inside herself. a long talk which she didn't understand; and in the end she started crying louder than ever. \"oh, don't cry, linda. don't cry.\" he pressed himself against her. he put his arm round her neck. linda cried out. \"oh, be careful. my shoulder! oh!\" and she pushed him away, hard. his head banged against the wall. \"little idiot!\" she shouted; and then, suddenly, she began to slap him. slap, slap ... \"linda,\" he cried out. \"oh, mother, don't!\" \"i'm not your mother. i won't be your mother.\" \"but, linda ... oh!\" she slapped him on the cheek. \"turned into a savage,\" she shouted. \"having young ones like an ani- mal ... if it hadn't been for you, i might have gone to the inspector, i might have got away. but not with a baby. that would have been too shameful.\" he saw that she was going to hit him again, and lifted his arm to guard his face. \"oh, don't, linda, please don't.\" \"little beast!\" she pulled down his arm; his face was uncovered. \"don't, linda.\" he shut his eyes, expecting the blow. but she didn't hit him. after a little time, he opened his eyes again and saw that she was looking at him. he tried to smile at her. suddenly she put her arms round him and kissed him again and again. sometimes, for several days, linda didn't get up at all. she lay in bed and was sad. or else she drank the stuff that pope brought and laughed a great deal and went to sleep. sometimes she was sick. of- ten she forgot to wash him, and there was nothing to eat except cold tortillas. he remembered the first time she found those little animals in his hair, how she screamed and screamed. the happiest times were when she told him about the other place. \"and you really can go flying, whenever you like?\" \"whenever you like.\" and she would tell him about the lovely music that came out of a box, and all the nice games you could play, and the delicious things to eat and drink, and the light that came when you pressed a little thing in the wall, and the pictures that you could hear and feel and smell, as well as see, and another box for making nice smells, and the pink and green and blue and silver houses as high as mountains, and everybody happy and no one ever sad or angry, and every one belonging to every one else, and the boxes where you could see and hear what was happening at the other side of the world, and babies in lovely clean bottles-everything so clean, and no nasty smells, no dirt at all-and people never lonely, but living together and being so jolly and happy, like the summer dances here in malpais, but much happier, and the happiness being there every day, every day. ... he listened by the hour. and sometimes, when he and the other chil- dren were tired with too much playing, one of the old men of the pueblo would talk to them, in those other words, of the great trans- former of the world, and of the long fight between right hand and left hand, between wet and dry; of awonawilona, who made a great fog by thinking in the night, and then made the whole world out of the fog; of earth mother and sky father; of ahaiyuta and marsailema, the twins of war and chance; of jesus and pookong; of mary and etsanat- lehi, the woman who makes herself young again; of the black stone at laguna and the great eagle and our lady of acoma. strange stories, all the more wonderful to him for being told in the other words and so not fully understood. lying in bed, he would think of heaven and lon- don and our lady of acoma and the rows and rows of babies in clean bottles and jesus flying up and linda flying up and the great director of world hatcheries and awonawilona. lots of men came to see linda. the boys began to point their fingers at him. in the strange other words they said that linda was bad; they called her names he did not understand, but that he knew were bad names. one day they sang a song about her, again and again. he threw stones at them. they threw back; a sharp stone cut his cheek. the blood wouldn't stop; he was covered with blood. linda taught him to read. with a piece of charcoal she drew pictures on the wall-an animal sitting down, a baby inside a bottle; then she wrote letters. the cat is on the mat the tot is in the pot he learned quickly and easily. when he knew how to read all the words she wrote on the wall, linda opened her big wooden box and pulled out from under those funny little red trousers she never wore a thin lit- tle book. he had often seen it before. \"when you're bigger,\" she had said, \"you can read it.\" well, now he was big enough. he was proud. \"i'm afraid you won't find it very exciting,\" she said. \"but it's the only thing i have.\" she sighed. \"if only you could see the lovely reading machines we used to have in london!\" he began reading. the chemi- cal and bacteriological conditioning of the embryo. practical instruc- tions for beta embryo-store workers. it took him a quarter of an hour to read the title alone. he threw the book on the floor. \"beastly, beastly book!\" he said, and began to cry. the boys still sang their horrible song about linda. sometimes, too, they laughed at him for being so ragged. when he tore his clothes, linda did not know how to mend them. in the other place, she told him, people threw away clothes with holes in them and got new ones. \"rags, rags!\" the boys used to shout at him. \"but i can read,\" he said to himself, \"and they can't. they don't even know what reading is.\" it was fairly easy, if he thought hard enough about the reading, to pre- tend that he didn't mind when they made fun of him. he asked linda to give him the book again. the more the boys pointed and sang, the harder he read. soon he could read all the words quite well. even the longest. but what did they mean? he asked linda; but even when she could answer it didn't seem to make it very clear, and generally she couldn't answer at all. \"what are chemicals?\" he would ask. \"oh, stuff like magnesium salts, and alcohol for keeping the deltas and epsilons small and backward, and calcium carbonate for bones, and all that sort of thing.\" \"but how do you make chemicals, linda? where do they come from?\" \"well, i don't know. you get them out of bottles. and when the bottles are empty, you send up to the chemical store for more. it's the chemical store people who make them, i suppose. or else they send to the factory for them. i don't know. i never did any chemistry. my job was always with the embryos. it was the same with everything else he asked about. linda never seemed to know. the old men of the pueblo had much more definite answers. \"the seed of men and all creatures, the seed of the sun and the seed of earth and the seed of the sky-awonawilona made them all out of the fog of increase. now the world has four wombs; and he laid the seeds in the lowest of the four wombs. and gradually the seeds began to grow ...\" one day (john calculated later that it must have been soon after his twelfth birthday) he came home and found a book that he had never seen before lying on the floor in the bedroom. it was a thick book and looked very old. the binding had been eaten by mice; some of its pages were loose and crumpled. he picked it up, looked at the title- page: the book was called the complete works of william shake- speare. linda was lying on the bed, sipping that horrible stinking mescal out of a cup. \"pope brought it,\" she said. her voice was thick and hoarse like somebody else's voice. \"it was lying in one of the chests of the ante- lope kiva. it's supposed to have been there for hundreds of years. i expect it's true, because i looked at it, and it seemed to be full of non- sense. uncivilized. still, it'll be good enough for you to practice your reading on.\" she took a last sip, set the cup down on the floor beside the bed, turned over on her side, hiccoughed once or twice and went to sleep. he opened the book at random. nay, but to live in the rank sweat of an enseamed bed, stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love over the nasty sty ... the strange words rolled through his mind; rumbled, like talking thun- der; like the drums at the summer dances, if the drums could have spoken; like the men singing the corn song, beautiful, beautiful, so that you cried; like old mitsima saying magic over his feathers and his carved sticks and his bits of bone and stone-kiathla tsilu silokwe si- lokwe silokwe. kiai silu silu, tsithl-but better than mitsima's magic, be- cause it meant more, because it talked to him, talked wonderfully and only half-understandably, a terrible beautiful magic, about linda; about linda lying there snoring, with the empty cup on the floor beside the bed; about linda and pope, linda and pope. he hated pope more and more. a man can smile and smile and be a villain. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain. what did the words exactly mean? he only half knew. but their magic was strong and went on rumbling in his head, and somehow it was as though he had never really hated pope before; never really hated him because he had never been able to say how much he hated him. but now he had these words, these words like drums and singing and magic. these words and the strange, strange story out of which they were taken (he couldn't make head or tail of it, but it was wonderful, wonderful all the same)-they gave him a reason for hating pope; and they made his hatred more real; they even made pope himself more real. one day, when he came in from playing, the door of the inner room was open, and he saw them lying together on the bed, asleep-white linda and pope almost black beside her, with one arm under her shoulders and the other dark hand on her breast, and one of the plaits of his long hair lying across her throat, like a black snake trying to strangle her. pope's gourd and a cup were standing on the floor near the bed. linda was snoring. his heart seemed to have disappeared and left a hole. he was empty. empty, and cold, and rather sick, and giddy. he leaned against the wall to steady himself. remorseless, treacherous, lecherous ... like drums, like the men singing for the corn, like magic, the words repeated and repeated themselves in his head. from being cold he was suddenly hot. his cheeks burnt with the rush of blood, the room swam and darkened before his eyes. he ground his teeth. \"i'll kill him, i'll kill him, i'll kill him,\" he kept saying. and suddenly there were more words. when he is drunk asleep, or in his rage or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed ... the magic was on his side, the magic explained and gave orders. he stepped back in the outer room. \"when he is drunk asleep ...\" the knife for the meat was lying on the floor near the fireplace. he picked it up and tiptoed to the door again. \"when he is drunk asleep, drunk asleep ...\" he ran across the room and stabbed-oh, the bloodl-stabbed again, as pope heaved out of his sleep, lifted his hand to stab once more, but found his wrist caught, held and-oh, oh!-twisted. he couldn't move, he was trapped, and there were pope's small black eyes, very close, staring into his own. he looked away. there were two cuts on pope's left shoulder. \"oh, look at the blood!\" linda was crying. \"look at the blood!\" she had never been able to bear the sight of blood. pope lifted his other hand-to strike him, he thought. he stiff- ened to receive the blow. but the hand only took him under the chin and turned his face, so that he had to look again into pope's eyes. for a long time, for hours and hours. and suddenly-he couldn't help it-he began to cry. pope burst out laughing. \"go,\" he said, in the other in- dian words. \"go, my brave ahaiyuta.\" he ran out into the other room to hide his tears. \"you are fifteen,\" said old mitsima, in the indian words. \"now i may teach you to work the clay.\" squatting by the river, they worked together. \"first of all,\" said mitsima, taking a lump of the wetted clay between his hands, \"we make a little moon.\" the old man squeezed the lump into a disk, then bent up the edges, the moon became a shallow cup. slowly and unskilfully he imitated the old man's delicate gestures. \"a moon, a cup, and now a snake.\" mitsima rolled out another piece of clay into a long flexible cylinder, trooped it into a circle and pressed it on to the rim of the cup. \"then another snake. and another. and an- other.\" round by round, mitsima built up the sides of the pot; it was narrow, it bulged, it narrowed again towards the neck. mitsima squeezed and patted, stroked and scraped; and there at last it stood, in shape the familiar water pot of malpais, but creamy white instead of black, and still soft to the touch. the crooked parody of mitsima's, his own stood beside it. looking at the two pots, he had to laugh. \"but the next one will be better,\" he said, and began to moisten an- other piece of clay. to fashion, to give form, to feel his fingers gaining in skill and pow- er-this gave him an extraordinary pleasure. \"a, b, c, vitamin d,\" he sang to himself as he worked. \"the fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea.\" and mitsima also sang-a song about killing a bear. they worked all day, and all day he was filled with an intense, absorbing happiness. \"next winter,\" said old mitsima, \"i will teach you to make the bow.\" he stood for a long time outside the house, and at last the ceremonies within were finished. the door opened; they came out. kothlu came first, his right hand out-stretched and tightly closed, as though over some precious jewel. her clenched hand similarly outstretched, kiakime followed. they walked in silence, and in silence, behind them, came the brothers and sisters and cousins and all the troop of old peo- ple. they walked out of the pueblo, across the mesa. at the edge of the cliff they halted, facing the early morning sun. kothlu opened his hand. a pinch of corn meal lay white on the palm; he breathed on it, mur- mured a few words, then threw it, a handful of white dust, towards the sun. kiakime did the same. then khakime's father stepped forward, and holding up a feathered prayer stick, made a long prayer, then threw the stick after the corn meal. \"it is finished,\" said old mitsima in a loud voice. \"they are married.\" \"well,\" said linda, as they turned away, \"all i can say is, it does seem a lot of fuss to make about so little. in civilized countries, when a boy wants to have a girl, he just ... but where are you going, john?\" he paid no attention to her calling, but ran on, away, away, anywhere to be by himself. it is finished old mitsima's words repeated themselves in his mind. finished, finished ... in silence and from a long way off, but violently, desperately, hopelessly, he had loved kiakime. and now it was fin- ished. he was sixteen. at the full moon, in the antelope kiva, secrets would be told, secrets would be done and borne. they would go down, boys, into the kiva and come out again, men. the boys were all afraid and at the same time impatient. and at last it was the day. the sun went down, the moon rose. he went with the others. men were standing, dark, at the entrance to the kiva; the ladder went down into the red lighted depths. already the leading boys had begun to climb down. suddenly, one of the men stepped forward, caught him by the arm, and pulled him out of the ranks. he broke free and dodged back into his place among the others. this time the man struck him, pulled his hair. \"not for you, white-hair!\" \"not for the son of the she-dog,\" said one of the other men. the boys laughed. \"go!\" and as he still hovered on the fringes of the group, \"go!\" the men shouted again. one of them bent down, took a stone, threw it. \"go, go, go!\" there was a shower of stones. bleed- ing, he ran away into the darkness. from the red-lit kiva came the noise of singing. the last of the boys had climbed down the ladder. he was all alone. all alone, outside the pueblo, on the bare plain of the mesa. the rock was like bleached bones in the moonlight. down in the valley, the coyotes were howling at the moon. the bruises hurt him, the cuts were still bleeding; but it was not for pain that he sobbed; it was be- cause he was all alone, because he had been driven out, alone, into this skeleton world of rocks and moonlight. at the edge of the preci- pice he sat down. the moon was behind him; he looked down into the black shadow of the mesa, into the black shadow of death. he had only to take one step, one little jump. ... he held out his right hand in the moonlight. from the cut on his wrist the blood was still oozing. every few seconds a drop fell, dark, almost colourless in the dead light. drop, drop, drop. to-morrow and to-morrow and to-morrow ... he had discovered time and death and god. \"alone, always alone,\" the young man was saying. the words awoke a plaintive echo in bernard's mind. alone, alone ... \"so am i,\" he said, on a gush of confidingness. \"terribly alone.\" \"are you?\" john looked surprised. \"i thought that in the other place ... i mean, linda always said that nobody was ever alone there.\" bernard blushed uncomfortably. \"you see,\" he said, mumbling and with averted eyes, \"i'm rather different from most people, i suppose. if one happens to be decanted different ...\" \"yes, that's just it.\" the young man nodded. \"if one's different, one's bound to be lonely. they're beastly to one. do you know, they shut me out of absolutely everything? when the other boys were sent out to spend the night on the mountains-you know, when you have to dream which your sacred animal is-they wouldn't let me go with the others; they wouldn't tell me any of the secrets. i did it by myself, though,\" he added. \"didn't eat anything for five days and then went out one night alone into those mountains there.\" he pointed. patronizingly, bernard smiled. \"and did you dream of anything?\" he asked. the other nodded. \"but i mustn't tell you what.\" he was silent for a lit- tle; then, in a low voice, \"once,\" he went on, \"i did something that none of the others did: i stood against a rock in the middle of the day, in summer, with my arms out, like jesus on the cross.\" \"what on earth for?\" \"i wanted to know what it was like being crucified. hanging there in the sun ...\" \"but why?\" \"why? well ...\" he hesitated. \"because i felt i ought to. if jesus could stand it. and then, if one has done something wrong ... besides, i was unhappy; that was another reason.\" \"it seems a funny way of curing your unhappiness,\" said bernard. but on second thoughts he decided that there was, after all, some sense in it. better than taking soma ... \"i fainted after a time,\" said the young man. \"fell down on my face. do you see the mark where i cut myself?\" he lifted the thick yellow hair from his forehead. the scar showed, pale and puckered, on his right temple. bernard looked, and then quickly, with a little shudder, averted his eyes. his conditioning had made him not so much pitiful as profoundly squeamish. the mere suggestion of illness or wounds was to him not only horrifying, but even repulsive and rather disgusting. like dirt, or deformity, or old age. hastily he changed the subject. \"i wonder if you'd like to come back to london with us?\" he asked, making the first move in a campaign whose strategy he had been se- cretly elaborating ever since, in the little house, he had realized who the \"father\" of this young savage must be. \"would you like that?\" the young man's face lit up. \"do you really mean it?\" \"of course; if i can get permission, that is.\" \"linda too?\" \"well ...\" he hesitated doubtfully. that revolting creature! no, it was impossible. unless, unless ... it suddenly occurred to bernard that her very revoltingness might prove an enormous asset. \"but of course!\" he cried, making up for his first hesitations with an excess of noisy cor- diality. the young man drew a deep breath. \"to think it should be coming true-what i've dreamt of all my life. do you remember what miranda says?\" \"who's miranda?\" but the young man had evidently not heard the question. \"o wonder!\" he was saying; and his eyes shone, his face was brightly flushed. \"how many goodly creatures are there here! how beauteous mankind is!\" the flush suddenly deepened; he was thinking of lenina, of an angel in bottle-green viscose, lustrous with youth and skin food, plump, be- nevolently smiling. his voice faltered. \"o brave new world,\" he began, then-suddenly interrupted himself; the blood had left his cheeks; he was as pale as paper. \"are you married to her?\" he asked. \"am i what?\" \"married. you know-for ever. they say 'for ever' in the indian words; it can't be broken.\" \"ford, no!\" bernard couldn't help laughing. john also laughed, but for another reason-laughed for pure joy. \"o brave new world,\" he repeated. \"o brave new world that has such people in it. let's start at once.\" \"you have a most peculiar way of talking sometimes,\" said bernard, staring at the young man in perplexed astonishment. \"and, anyhow, hadn't you better wait till you actually see the new world?\" chapter nine lenina felt herself entitled, after this day of queerness and horror, to a complete and absolute holiday. as soon as they got back to the rest- house, she swallowed six half-gramme tablets of soma, lay down on her bed, and within ten minutes had embarked for lunar eternity. it would be eighteen hours at the least before she was in time again. bernard meanwhile lay pensive and wide-eyed in the dark. it was long after midnight before he fell asleep. long after midnight; but his in- somnia had not been fruitless; he had a plan. punctually, on the following morning, at ten o'clock, the green- uniformed octoroon stepped out of his helicopter. bernard was waiting for him among the agaves. \"miss crowne's gone on soma-holiday,\" he explained. \"can hardly be back before five. which leaves us seven hours.\" he could fly to santa fe, do all the business he had to do, and be in malpais again long before she woke up. \"she'll be quite safe here by herself?\" \"safe as helicopters,\" the octoroon assured him. they climbed into the machine and started off at once. at ten thirty- four they landed on the roof of the santa fe post office; at ten thirty- seven bernard had got through to the world controller's office in whitehall; at ten thirty-seven he was speaking to his fordship's fourth personal secretary; at ten forty-four he was repeating his story to the first secretary, and at ten forty-seven and a half it was the deep, reso- nant voice of mustapha mond himself that sounded in his ears. \"i ventured to think,\" stammered bernard, \"that your fordship might find the matter of sufficient scientific interest ...\" \"yes, i do find it of sufficient scientific interest,\" said the deep voice. \"bring these two individuals back to london with you.\" \"your fordship is aware that i shall need a special permit ...\" \"the necessary orders,\" said mustapha mond, \"are being sent to the warden of the reservation at this moment. you will proceed at once to the warden's office. good-morning, mr. marx.\" there was silence. bernard hung up the receiver and hurried up to the roof. \"warden's office,\" he said to the gamma-green octoroon. at ten fifty-four bernard was shaking hands with the warden. \"delighted, mr. marx, delighted.\" his boom was deferential. \"we have just received special orders ...\" \"i know,\" said bernard, interrupting him. \"i was talking to his fordship on the phone a moment ago.\" his bored tone implied that he was in the habit of talking to his fordship every day of the week. he dropped into a chair. \"if you'll kindly take all the necessary steps as soon as possible. as soon as possible,\" he emphatically repeated. he was thor- oughly enjoying himself. at eleven three he had all the necessary papers in his pocket. \"so long,\" he said patronizingly to the warden, who had accompanied him as far as the lift gates. \"so long.\" he walked across to the hotel, had a bath, a vibro-vac massage, and an electrolytic shave, listened in to the morning's news, looked in for half an hour on the televisor, ate a leisured luncheon, and at half-past two flew back with the octoroon to malpais. the young man stood outside the rest-house. \"bernard,\" he called. \"bernard!\" there was no answer. noiseless on his deerksin moccasins, he ran up the steps and tried the door. the door was locked. they were gone! gone! it was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to him. she had asked him to come and see them, and now they were gone. he sat down on the steps and cried. half an hour later it occurred to him to look through the window. the first thing he saw was a green suit-case, with the initials l.c. painted on the lid. joy flared up like fire within him. he picked up a stone. the smashed glass tinkled on the floor. a moment later he was inside the room. he opened the green suit-case; and all at once he was breathing lenina's perfume, filling his lungs with her essential being. his heart beat wildly; for a moment he was almost faint. then, bending over the precious box, he touched, he lifted into the light, he examined. the zippers on lenina's spare pair of viscose velveteen shorts were at first a puzzle, then solved, a delight. zip, and then zip; zip, and then zip; he was enchanted. her green slippers were the most beautiful things he had ever seen. he unfolded a pair of zippicamiknicks, blushed, put them hastily away again; but kissed a perfumed acetate handkerchief and wound a scarf round his neck. opening a box, he spilt a cloud of scented powder. his hands were floury with the stuff. he wiped them on his chest, on his shoulders, on his bare arms. delicious perfume! he shut his eyes; he rubbed his cheek against his own powdered arm. touch of smooth skin against his face, scent in his nostrils of musky dust-her real presence. \"lenina,\" he whispered. \"lenina!\" a noise made him start, made him guiltily turn. he crammed up his thieveries into the suit-case and shut the lid; then listened again, looked. not a sign of life, not a sound. and yet he had certainly heard something-something like a sigh, something like the creak of a board. he tiptoed to the door and, cautiously opening it, found himself looking on to a broad landing. on the opposite side of the landing was another door, ajar. he stepped out, pushed, peeped. there, on a low bed, the sheet flung back, dressed in a pair of pink one-piece zippyjamas, lay lenina, fast asleep and so beautiful in the midst of her curls, so touchingly childish with her pink toes and her grave sleeping face, so trustful in the helplessness of her limp hands and melted limbs, that the tears came to his eyes. with an infinity of quite unnecessary precautions-for nothing short of a pistol shot could have called lenina back from her soma-holiday before the appointed time-he entered the room, he knelt on the floor beside the bed. he gazed, he clasped his hands, his lips moved. \"her eyes,\" he murmured, \"her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice; handiest in thy discourse o! that her hand, in whose comparison all whites are ink writing their own reproach; to whose soft seizure the cygnet's down is harsh ...\" a fly buzzed round her; he waved it away. \"flies,\" he remembered, \"on the white wonder of dear juliet's hand, may seize and steal immortal blessing from her lips, who, even in pure and vestal modesty, still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin. \" very slowly, with the hesitating gesture of one who reaches forward to stroke a shy and possibly rather dangerous bird, he put out his hand. it hung there trembling, within an inch of those limp fingers, on the verge of contact. did he dare? dare to profane with his unworthiest hand that ... no, he didn't. the bird was too dangerous. his hand dropped back. how beautiful she was! how beautiful! then suddenly he found himself reflecting that he had only to take hold of the zipper at her neck and give one long, strong pull ... he shut his eyes, he shook his head with the gesture of a dog shaking its ears as it emerges from the water. detestable thought! he was ashamed of himself. pure and vestal modesty ... there was a humming in the air. another fly trying to steal immortal blessings? a wasp? he looked, saw nothing. the humming grew louder and louder, localized itself as being outside the shuttered windows. the plane! in a panic, he scrambled to his feet and ran into the other room, vaulted through the open window, and hurrying along the path between the tall agaves was in time to receive bernard marx as he climbed out of the helicopter. chapter ten the hands of all the four thousand electric clocks in all the blooms- bury centre's four thousand rooms marked twenty-seven minutes past two. \"this hive of industry,\" as the director was fond of calling it, was in the full buzz of work. every one was busy, everything in ordered motion. under the microscopes, their long tails furiously lashing, spermatozoa were burrowing head first into eggs; and, fertilized, the eggs were expanding, dividing, or if bokanovskified, budding and breaking up into whole populations of separate embryos. from the so- cial predestination room the escalators went rumbling down into the basement, and there, in the crimson darkness, stewingly warm on their cushion of peritoneum and gorged with blood-surrogate and hormones, the foetuses grew and grew or, poisoned, languished into a stunted epsilonhood. with a faint hum and rattle the moving racks crawled imperceptibly through the weeks and the recapitulated aeons to where, in the decanting room, the newly-unbottled babes uttered their first yell of horror and amazement. the dynamos purred in the sub-basement, the lifts rushed up and down. on all the eleven floors of nurseries it was feeding time. from eighteen hundred bottles eighteen hundred carefully labelled infants were simultaneously sucking down their pint of pasteurized external secretion. above them, in ten successive layers of dormitory, the little boys and girls who were still young enough to need an afternoon sleep were as busy as every one else, though they did not know it, listening uncon- sciously to hypnopaedic lessons in hygiene and sociability, in class- consciousness and the toddler's love-life. above these again were the playrooms where, the weather having turned to rain, nine hundred older children were amusing themselves with bricks and clay model- ling, hunt-the-zipper, and erotic play. buzz, buzz! the hive was humming, busily, joyfully. blithe was the singing of the young girls over their test-tubes, the predestinators whistled as they worked, and in the decanting room what glorious jokes were cracked above the empty bottles! but the director's face, as he entered the fertilizing room with henry foster, was grave, wooden with severity. \"a public example,\" he was saying. \"in this room, because it contains more high-caste workers than any other in the centre. i have told him to meet me here at half-past two.\" \"he does his work very well,\" put in henry, with hypocritical generos- ity. \"i know. but that's all the more reason for severity. his intellectual eminence carries with it corresponding moral responsibilities. the greater a man's talents, the greater his power to lead astray. it is bet- ter that one should suffer than that many should be corrupted. con- sider the matter dispassionately, mr. foster, and you will see that no offence is so heinous as unorthodoxy of behaviour. murder kills only the individual-and, after all, what is an individual?\" with a sweeping gesture he indicated the rows of microscopes, the test-tubes, the incu- bators. \"we can make a new one with the greatest ease-as many as we like. unorthodoxy threatens more than the life of a mere individual; it strikes at society itself. yes, at society itself,\" he repeated. \"ah, but here he comes.\" bernard had entered the room and was advancing between the rows of fertilizers towards them. a veneer of jaunty self-confidence thinly con- cealed his nervousness. the voice in which he said, \"good-morning, director,\" was absurdly too loud; that in which, correcting his mistake, he said, \"you asked me to come and speak to you here,\" ridiculously soft, a squeak. \"yes, mr. marx,\" said the director portentously. \"i did ask you to come to me here. you returned from your holiday last night, i understand.\" \"yes,\" bernard answered. \"yes-s,\" repeated the director, lingering, a serpent, on the \"s.\" then, suddenly raising his voice, \"ladies and gentlemen,\" he trumpeted, \"la- dies and gentlemen.\" the singing of the girls over their test-tubes, the preoccupied whistling of the microscopists, suddenly ceased. there was a profound silence; every one looked round. \"ladies and gentlemen,\" the director repeated once more, \"excuse me for thus interrupting your labours. a painful duty constrains me. the security and stability of society are in danger. yes, in danger, ladies and gentlemen. this man,\" he pointed accusingly at bernard, \"this man who stands before you here, this alpha-plus to whom so much has been given, and from whom, in consequence, so much must be expected, this colleague of yours-or should i anticipate and say this ex-colleague?-has grossly betrayed the trust imposed in him. by his heretical views on sport and soma, by the scandalous unorthodoxy of his sex-life, by his refusal to obey the teachings of our ford and be- have out of office hours, 'even as a little infant,'\" (here the director made the sign of the t), \"he has proved himself an enemy of society, a subverter, ladies and gentlemen, of all order and stability, a con- spirator against civilization itself. for this reason i propose to dismiss him, to dismiss him with ignominy from the post he has held in this centre; i propose forthwith to apply for his transference to a subcen- tre of the lowest order and, that his punishment may serve the best interest of society, as far as possible removed from any important centre of population. in iceland he will have small opportunity to lead others astray by his unfordly example.\" the director paused; then, folding his arms, he turned impressively to bernard. \"marx,\" he said, \"can you show any reason why i should not now execute the judgment passed upon you?\" \"yes, i can,\" bernard answered in a very loud voice. somewhat taken aback, but still majestically, \"then show it,\" said the director. \"certainly. but it's in the passage. one moment.\" bernard hurried to the door and threw it open. \"come in,\" he commanded, and the reason came in and showed itself. there was a gasp, a murmur of astonishment and horror; a young girl screamed; standing on a chair to get a better view some one upset two test-tubes full of spermatozoa. bloated, sagging, and among those firm youthful bodies, those undistorted faces, a strange and terrifying monster of middle-agedness, linda advanced into the room, coquet- tishly smiling her broken and discoloured smile, and rolling as she walked, with what was meant to be a voluptuous undulation, her enormous haunches. bernard walked beside her. \"there he is,\" he said, pointing at the director. \"did you think i didn't recognize him?\" linda asked indignantly; then, turning to the director, \"of course i knew you; tomakin, i should have known you anywhere, among a thousand. but perhaps you've forgot- ten me. don't you remember? don't you remember, tomakin? your linda.\" she stood looking at him, her head on one side, still smiling, but with a smile that became progressively, in face of the director's expression of petrified disgust, less and less self-confident, that wa- vered and finally went out. \"don't you remember, tomakin?\" she re- peated in a voice that trembled. her eyes were anxious, agonized. the blotched and sagging face twisted grotesquely into the grimace of ex- treme grief. \"tomakin!\" she held out her arms. some one began to tit- ter. \"what's the meaning,\" began the director, \"of this monstrous ...\" \"tomakin!\" she ran forward, her blanket trailing behind her, threw her arms round his neck, hid her face on his chest. a howl of laughter went up irrepressibly. \"... this monstrous practical joke,\" the director shouted. red in the face, he tried to disengage himself from her embrace. des- perately she clung. \"but i'm linda, i'm linda.'\" the laughter drowned her voice. \"you made me have a baby,\" she screamed above the up- roar. there was a sudden and appalling hush; eyes floated uncom- fortably, not knowing where to look. the director went suddenly pale, stopped struggling and stood, his hands on her wrists, staring down at her, horrified. \"yes, a baby-and i was its mother.\" she flung the ob- scenity like a challenge into the outraged silence; then, suddenly breaking away from him, ashamed, ashamed, covered her face with her hands, sobbing. \"it wasn't my fault, tomakin. because i always did my drill, didn't i? didn't i? always ... i don't know how ... if you knew how awful, tomakin ... but he was a comfort to me, all the same.\" turning towards the door, \"john!\" she called. \"john!\" he came in at once, paused for a moment just inside the door, looked round, then soft on his moccasined feet strode quickly across the room, fell on his knees in front of the director, and said in a clear voice: \"my father!\" the word (for \"father\" was not so much obscene as-with its connota- tion of something at one remove from the loathsomeness and moral obliquity of child-bearing-merely gross, a scatological rather than a pornographic impropriety); the comically smutty word relieved what had become a quite intolerable tension. laughter broke out, enor- mous, almost hysterical, peal after peal, as though it would never stop. my father-and it was the director! my father! oh ford, oh ford! that was really too good. the whooping and the roaring renewed themselves, faces seemed on the point of disintegration, tears were streaming. six more test-tubes of spermatozoa were upset. my father! pale, wild-eyed, the director glared about him in an agony of bewil- dered humiliation. my father! the laughter, which had shown signs of dying away, broke out again more loudly than ever. he put his hands over his ears and rushed out of the room. chapter eleven after the scene in the fertilizing room, all upper-caste london was wild to see this delicious creature who had fallen on his knees before the director of hatcheries and conditioning-or rather the ex-director, for the poor man had resigned immediately afterwards and never set foot inside the centre again-had flopped down and called him (the joke was almost too good to be true!) \"my father.\" linda, on the con- trary, cut no ice; nobody had the smallest desire to see linda. to say one was a mother-that was past a joke: it was an obscenity. moreover, she wasn't a real savage, had been hatched out of a bottle and condi- tioned like any one else: so couldn't have really quaint ideas. final- ly-and this was by far the strongest reason for people's not wanting to see poor linda-there was her appearance. fat; having lost her youth; with bad teeth, and a blotched complexion, and that figure (fordl)-you simply couldn't look at her without feeling sick, yes, positively sick. so the best people were quite determined not to see linda. and linda, for her part, had no desire to see them. the return to civilization was for her the return to soma, was the possibility of lying in bed and taking holiday after holiday, without ever having to come back to a headache or a fit of vomiting, without ever being made to feel as you always felt after peyotl, as though you'd done something so shamefully anti-social that you could never hold up your head again. soma played none of these unpleasant tricks. the holiday it gave was perfect and, if the morning after was disagreeable, it was so, not intrinsically, but only by comparison with the joys of the holiday. the remedy was to make the holiday continuous. greedily she clamoured for ever larger, ever more frequent doses. dr. shaw at first demurred; then let her have what she wanted. she took as much as twenty grammes a day. \"which will finish her off in a month or two,\" the doctor confided to bernard. \"one day the respiratory centre will be paralyzed. no more breathing. finished. and a good thing too. if we could rejuvenate, of course it would be different. but we can't.\" surprisingly, as every one thought (for on soma-holiday linda was most conveniently out of the way), john raised objections. \"but aren't you shortening her life by giving her so much?\" \"in one sense, yes,\" dr. shaw admitted. \"but in another we're actually lengthening it.\" the young man stared, uncomprehending. \"soma may make you lose a few years in time,\" the doctor went on. \"but think of the enormous, immeasurable durations it can give you out of time. every soma-holiday is a bit of what our ancestors used to call eter- nity.\" john began to understand. \"eternity was in our lips and eyes,\" he murmured. \"eh?\" \"nothing.\" \"of course,\" dr. shaw went on, \"you can't allow people to go popping off into eternity if they've got any serious work to do. but as she hasn't got any serious work ...\" \"all the same,\" john persisted, \"i don't believe it's right.\" the doctor shrugged his shoulders. \"well, of course, if you prefer to have her screaming mad all the time ...\" in the end john was forced to give in. linda got her soma. thencefor- ward she remained in her little room on the thirty-seventh floor of bernard's apartment house, in bed, with the radio and television al- ways on, and the patchouli tap just dripping, and the soma tablets within reach of her hand-there she remained; and yet wasn't there at all, was all the time away, infinitely far away, on holiday; on holiday in some other world, where the music of the radio was a labyrinth of so- norous colours, a sliding, palpitating labyrinth, that led (by what beau- tifully inevitable windings) to a bright centre of absolute conviction; where the dancing images of the television box were the performers in some indescribably delicious all-singing feely; where the dripping patchouli was more than scent-was the sun, was a million saxophones, was pope making love, only much more so, incomparably more, and without end. \"no, we can't rejuvenate. but i'm very glad,\" dr. shaw had concluded, \"to have had this opportunity to see an example of senility in a human being. thank you so much for calling me in.\" he shook bernard warmly by the hand. it was john, then, they were all after. and as it was only through ber- nard, his accredited guardian, that john could be seen, bernard now found himself, for the first time in his life, treated not merely normally, but as a person of outstanding importance. there was no more talk of the alcohol in his blood-surrogate, no gibes at his personal appear- ance. henry foster went out of his way to be friendly; benito hoover made him a present of six packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum; the assistant predestinator came out and cadged almost abjectly for an in- vitation to one of bernard's evening parties. as for the women, ber- nard had only to hint at the possibility of an invitation, and he could have whichever of them he liked. \"bernard's asked me to meet the savage next wednesday,\" fanny an- nounced triumphantly. \"i'm so glad,\" said lenina. \"and now you must admit that you were wrong about bernard. don't you think he's really rather sweet?\" fanny nodded. \"and i must say,\" she said, \"i was quite agreeably sur- prised.\" the chief bottler, the director of predestination, three deputy assis- tant fertilizer-generals, the professor of feelies in the college of emo- tional engineering, the dean of the westminster community singery, the supervisor of bokanovskification-the list of bernard's notabilities was interminable. \"and i had six girls last week,\" he confided to helmholtz watson. \"one on monday, two on tuesday, two more on friday, and one on saturday. and if i'd had the time or the inclination, there were at least a dozen more who were only too anxious ...\" helmholtz listened to his boastings in a silence so gloomily disapprov- ing that bernard was offended. \"you're envious,\" he said. helmholtz shook his head. \"i'm rather sad, that's all,\" he answered. bernard went off in a huff. never, he told himself, never would he speak to helmholtz again. the days passed. success went fizzily to bernard's head, and in the process completely reconciled him (as any good intoxicant should do) to a world which, up till then, he had found very unsatisfactory. in so far as it recognized him as important, the order of things was good. but, reconciled by his success, he yet refused to forego the privilege of criticizing this order. for the act of criticizing heightened his sense of importance, made him feel larger. moreover, he did genuinely believe that there were things to criticize. (at the same time, he genuinely liked being a success and having all the girls he wanted.) before those who now, for the sake of the savage, paid their court to him, bernard would parade a carping unorthodoxy. he was politely listened to. but behind his back people shook their heads. \"that young man will come to a bad end,\" they said, prophesying the more confidently in that they themselves would in due course personally see to it that the end was bad. \"he won't find another savage to help him out a second time,\" they said. meanwhile, however, there was the first savage; they were polite. and because they were polite, bernard felt positively gigan- tic-gigantic and at the same time light with elation, lighter than air. \"lighter than air,\" said bernard, pointing upwards. like a pearl in the sky, high, high above them, the weather depart- ment's captive balloon shone rosily in the sunshine. \"... the said savage,\" so ran bernard's instructions, \"to be shown civi- lized life in all its aspects. ...\" he was being shown a bird's-eye view of it at present, a bird's-eye view from the platform of the charing-t tower. the station master and the resident meteorologist were acting as guides. but it was bernard who did most of the talking. intoxicated, he was behaving as though, at the very least, he were a visiting world controller. lighter than air. the bombay green rocket dropped out of the sky. the passengers alighted. eight identical dravidian twins in khaki looked out of the eight portholes of the cabin-the stewards. \"twelve hundred and fifty kilometres an hour,\" said the station master impressively. \"what do you think of that, mr. savage?\" john thought it very nice. \"still,\" he said, \"ariel could put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes.\" \"the savage,\" wrote bernard in his report to mustapha mond, \"shows surprisingly little astonishment at, or awe of, civilized inventions. this is partly due, no doubt, to the fact that he has heard them talked about by the woman linda, his m .\" (mustapha mond frowned. \"does the fool think i'm too squeamish to see the word written out at full length?\") \"partly on his interest being focussed on what he calls 'the soul,' which he persists in regarding as an entity independent of the physical envi- ronment, whereas, as i tried to point out to him ...\" the controller skipped the next sentences and was just about to turn the page in search of something more interestingly concrete, when his eye was caught by a series of quite extraordinary phrases. \" ... though i must admit,\" he read, \"that i agree with the savage in finding civi- lized infantility too easy or, as he puts it, not expensive enough; and i would like to take this opportunity of drawing your fordship's attention to ...\" mustapha mond's anger gave place almost at once to mirth. the idea of this creature solemnly lecturing him-fr/'m-about the social order was really too grotesque. the man must have gone mad. \"i ought to give him a lesson,\" he said to himself; then threw back his head and laughed aloud. for the moment, at any rate, the lesson would not be given. it was a small factory of lighting-sets for helicopters, a branch of the electrical equipment corporation. they were met on the roof itself (for that circular letter of recommendation from the controller was magical in its effects) by the chief technician and the human element man- ager. they walked downstairs into the factory. \"each process,\" explained the human element manager, \"is carried out, so far as possible, by a single bokanovsky group.\" and, in effect, eighty-three almost noseless black brachycephalic del- tas were cold-pressing. the fifty-six four-spindle chucking and turning machines were being manipulated by fifty-six aquiline and ginger gammas. one hundred and seven heat-conditioned epsilon senegalese were working in the foundry. thirty-three delta females, long-headed, sandy, with narrow pelvises, and all within 20 millimetres of 1 metre 69 centimetres tall, were cutting screws. in the assembling room, the dynamos were being put together by two sets of gamma-plus dwarfs. the two low work-tables faced one another; between them crawled the conveyor with its load of separate parts; forty-seven blonde heads were confronted by forty-seven brown ones. forty-seven snubs by forty-seven hooks; forty-seven receding by forty-seven prognathous chins. the completed mechanisms were inspected by eighteen identi- cal curly auburn girls in gamma green, packed in crates by thirty-four short-legged, left-handed male delta-minuses, and loaded into the waiting trucks and lorries by sixty-three blue-eyed, flaxen and freckled epsilon semi-morons. \"o brave new world ...\" by some malice of his memory the savage found himself repeating miranda's words. \"o brave new world that has such people in it.\" \"and i assure you,\" the human element manager concluded, as they left the factory, \"we hardly ever have any trouble with our workers. we always find ...\" but the savage had suddenly broken away from his companions and was violently retching, behind a clump of laurels, as though the solid earth had been a helicopter in an air pocket. \"the savage,\" wrote bernard, \"refuses to take soma, and seems much distressed because of the woman linda, his m , remains perma- nently on holiday. it is worthy of note that, in spite of his m 's senil- ity and the extreme repulsiveness of her appearance, the savage fre- quently goes to see her and appears to be much attached to her-an interesting example of the way in which early conditioning can be made to modify and even run counter to natural impulses (in this case, the impulse to recoil from an unpleasant object).\" at eton they alighted on the roof of upper school. on the opposite side of school yard, the fifty-two stories of lupton's tower gleamed white in the sunshine. college on their left and, on their right, the school community singery reared their venerable piles of ferro-concrete and vita-glass. in the centre of the quadrangle stood the quaint old chrome-steel statue of our ford. dr. gaffney, the provost, and miss keate, the head mistress, received them as they stepped out of the plane. \"do you have many twins here?\" the savage asked rather apprehen- sively, as they set out on their tour of inspection. \"oh, no,\" the provost answered. \"eton is reserved exclusively for upper-caste boys and girls. one egg, one adult. it makes education more difficult of course. but as they'll be called upon to take responsi- bilities and deal with unexpected emergencies, it can't be helped.\" he sighed. bernard, meanwhile, had taken a strong fancy to miss keate. \"if you're free any monday, wednesday, or friday evening,\" he was saying. jerk- ing his thumb towards the savage, \"he's curious, you know,\" bernard added. \"quaint.\" miss keate smiled (and her smile was really charming, he thought); said thank you; would be delighted to come to one of his parties. the provost opened a door. five minutes in that alpha double plus classroom left john a trifle be- wildered. \"what is elementary relativity?\" he whispered to bernard. bernard tried to explain, then thought better of it and suggested that they should go to some other classroom. from behind a door in the corridor leading to the beta-minus geogra- phy room, a ringing soprano voice called, \"one, two, three, four,\" and then, with a weary impatience, \"as you were.\" \"malthusian drill,\" explained the head mistress. \"most of our girls are freemartins, of course. i'm a freemartin myself.\" she smiled at ber- nard. \"but we have about eight hundred unsterilized ones who need constant drilling.\" in the beta-minus geography room john learnt that \"a savage reserva- tion is a place which, owing to unfavourable climatic or geological con- ditions, or poverty of natural resources, has not been worth the ex- pense of civilizing.\" a click; the room was darkened; and suddenly, on the screen above the master's head, there were the penitentes of acoma prostrating themselves before our lady, and wailing as john had heard them wail, confessing their sins before jesus on the cross, before the eagle image of pookong. the young etonians fairly shouted with laughter. still wailing, the penitentes rose to their feet, stripped off their upper garments and, with knotted whips, began to beat them- selves, blow after blow. redoubled, the laughter drowned even the amplified record of their groans. \"but why do they laugh?\" asked the savage in a pained bewilderment. \"why?\" the provost turned towards him a still broadly grinning face. \"why? but because it's so extraordinarily funny.\" in the cinematographic twilight, bernard risked a gesture which, in the past, even total darkness would hardly have emboldened him to make. strong in his new importance, he put his arm around the head mis- tress's waist. it yielded, willowily. he was just about to snatch a kiss or two and perhaps a gentle pinch, when the shutters clicked open again. \"perhaps we had better go on,\" said miss keate, and moved towards the door. \"and this,\" said the provost a moment later, \"is hypnopaedic control room.\" hundreds of synthetic music boxes, one for each dormitory, stood ranged in shelves round three sides of the room; pigeon-holed on the fourth were the paper sound-track rolls on which the various hyp- nopaedic lessons were printed. \"you slip the roll in here,\" explained bernard, interrupting dr. gaffney, \"press down this switch ...\" \"no, that one,\" corrected the provost, annoyed. \"that one, then. the roll unwinds. the selenium cells transform the light impulses into sound waves, and ...\" \"and there you are,\" dr. gaffney concluded. \"do they read shakespeare?\" asked the savage as they walked, on their way to the bio-chemical laboratories, past the school library. \"certainly not,\" said the head mistress, blushing. \"our library,\" said dr. gaffney, \"contains only books of reference. if our young people need distraction, they can get it at the feelies. we don't encourage them to indulge in any solitary amusements.\" five bus-loads of boys and girls, singing or in a silent embracement, rolled past them over the vitrified highway. \"just returned,\" explained dr. gaffney, while bernard, whispering, made an appointment with the head mistress for that very evening, \"from the slough crematorium. death conditioning begins at eighteen months. every tot spends two mornings a week in a hospital for the dying. all the best toys are kept there, and they get chocolate cream on death days. they learn to take dying as a matter of course.\" \"like any other physiological process,\" put in the head mistress pro- fessionally. eight o'clock at the savoy. it was all arranged. on their way back to london they stopped at the television corpora- tion's factory at brentford. \"do you mind waiting here a moment while i go and telephone?\" asked bernard. the savage waited and watched. the main day-shift was just going off duty. crowds of lower-caste workers were queued up in front of the monorail station-seven or eight hundred gamma, delta and epsilon men and women, with not more than a dozen faces and statures be- tween them. to each of them, with his or her ticket, the booking clerk pushed over a little cardboard pillbox. the long caterpillar of men and women moved slowly forward. \"what's in those\" (remembering the merchant of venice) \"those cas- kets?\" the savage enquired when bernard had rejoined him. \"the day's soma ration,\" bernard answered rather indistinctly; for he was masticating a piece of benito hoover's chewing-gum. \"they get it after their work's over. four half-gramme tablets. six on saturdays.\" he took john's arm affectionately and they walked back towards the helicopter. lenina came singing into the changing room. \"you seem very pleased with yourself,\" said fanny. \"i am pleased,\" she answered. zip! \"bernard rang up half an hour ago.\" zip, zip! she stepped out of her shorts. \"he has an unexpected engagement.\" zip! \"asked me if i'd take the savage to the feelies this evening. i must fly.\" she hurried away towards the bathroom. \"she's a lucky girl,\" fanny said to herself as she watched lenina go. there was no envy in the comment; good-natured fanny was merely stating a fact. lenina was lucky; lucky in having shared with bernard a generous portion of the savage's immense celebrity, lucky in reflecting from her insignificant person the moment's supremely fashionable glory. had not the secretary of the young women's fordian association asked her to give a lecture about her experiences? had she not been invited to the annual dinner of the aphroditeum club? had she not al- ready appeared in the feelytone news-visibly, audibly and tactually appeared to countless millions all over the planet? hardly less flattering had been the attentions paid her by conspicuous individuals. the resident world controller's second secretary had asked her to dinner and breakfast. she had spent one week-end with the ford chief-justice, and another with the arch-community-songster of canterbury. the president of the internal and external secretions corporation was perpetually on the phone, and she had been to deau- ville with the deputy-governor of the bank of europe. \"it's wonderful, of course. and yet in a way,\" she had confessed to fanny, \"i feel as though i were getting something on false pretences. because, of course, the first thing they all want to know is what it's like to make love to a savage. and i have to say i don't know.\" she shook her head. \"most of the men don't believe me, of course. but it's true. i wish it weren't,\" she added sadly and sighed. \"he's terribly good-looking; don't you think so?\" \"but doesn't he like you?\" asked fanny. \"sometimes i think he does and sometimes i think he doesn't. he al- ways does his best to avoid me; goes out of the room when i come in; won't touch me; won't even look at me. but sometimes if i turn round suddenly, i catch him staring; and then-well, you know how men look when they like you.\" yes, fanny knew. \"i can't make it out,\" said lenina. she couldn't make it out; and not only was bewildered; was also rather upset. \"because, you see, fanny, / like him.\" liked him more and more. well, now there'd be a real chance, she thought, as she scented herself after her bath. dab, dab, dab-a real chance. her high spirits overflowed in a song. \"hug me till you drug me, honey; kiss me till i'm in a coma; hug me, honey, snuggly bunny; love's as good as soma. \" the scent organ was playing a delightfully refreshing herbal capric- cio-rippling arpeggios of thyme and lavender, of rosemary, basil, myr- tle, tarragon; a series of daring modulations through the spice keys into ambergris; and a slow return through sandalwood, camphor, cedar and newmown hay (with occasional subtle touches of discord-a whiff of kidney pudding, the faintest suspicion of pig's dung) back to the simple aromatics with which the piece began. the final blast of thyme died away; there was a round of applause; the lights went up. in the synthetic music machine the sound-track roll began to unwind. it was a trio for hyper-violin, super-cello and oboe-surrogate that now filled the air with its agreeable languor. thirty or forty bars-and then, against this instrumental background, a much more than human voice began to warble; now throaty, now from the head, now hollow as a flute, now charged with yearning harmonics, it effortlessly passed from gaspard's forster's low record on the very frontiers of musical tone to a trilled bat-note high above the highest c to which (in 1770, at the ducal opera of parma, and to the astonishment of mozart) lucrezia ajugari, alone of all the singers in history, once piercingly gave utter- ance. sunk in their pneumatic stalls, lenina and the savage sniffed and lis- tened. it was now the turn also for eyes and skin. the house lights went down; fiery letters stood out solid and as though self-supported in the darkness. three weeks in a helicopter . an all-super-singing, synthetic-talking, coloured, stereo- scopic feely. with synchronized scent-organ accompani- ment. \"take hold of those metal knobs on the arms of your chair,\" whispered lenina. \"otherwise you won't get any of the feely effects.\" the savage did as he was told. those fiery letters, meanwhile, had disappeared; there were ten sec- onds of complete darkness; then suddenly, dazzling and incomparably more solid-looking than they would have seemed in actual flesh and blood, far more real than reality, there stood the stereoscopic images, locked in one another's arms, of a gigantic negro and a golden-haired young brachycephalic beta-plus female. the savage started. that sensation on his lips! he lifted a hand to his mouth; the titillation ceased; let his hand fall back on the metal knob; it began again. the scent organ, meanwhile, breathed pure musk. ex- piringly, a sound-track super-dove cooed \"oo-ooh\"; and vibrating only thirty-two times a second, a deeper than african bass made answer: \"aa-aah.\" \"ooh-ah! ooh-ah!\" the stereoscopic lips came together again, and once more the facial erogenous zones of the six thousand spectators in the alhambra tingled with almost intolerable galvanic pleasure. \"ooh ...\" the plot of the film was extremely simple. a few minutes after the first oohs and aahs (a duet having been sung and a little love made on that famous bearskin, every hair of which-the assistant predestinator was perfectly right-could be separately and distinctly felt), the negro had a helicopter accident, fell on his head. thump! what a twinge through the forehead! a chorus of ow's and aie's went up from the audience. the concussion knocked all the negro's conditioning into a cocked hat. he developed for the beta blonde an exclusive and maniacal passion. she protested. he persisted. there were struggles, pursuits, an assault on a rival, finally a sensational kidnapping. the beta blond was rav- ished away into the sky and kept there, hovering, for three weeks in a wildly anti-social tete-a-tete with the black madman. finally, after a whole series of adventures and much aerial acrobacy three handsome young alphas succeeded in rescuing her. the negro was packed off to an adult re-conditioning centre and the film ended happily and deco- rously, with the beta blonde becoming the mistress of all her three rescuers. they interrupted themselves for a moment to sing a syn- thetic quartet, with full super-orchestral accompaniment and gardenias on the scent organ. then the bearskin made a final appearance and, amid a blare of saxophones, the last stereoscopic kiss faded into dark- ness, the last electric titillation died on the lips like a dying moth that quivers, quivers, ever more feebly, ever more faintly, and at last is quiet, quite still. but for lenina the moth did not completely die. even after the lights had gone up, while they were shuffling slowly along with the crowd towards the lifts, its ghost still fluttered against her lips, still traced fine shuddering roads of anxiety and pleasure across her skin. her cheeks were flushed. she caught hold of the savage's arm and pressed it, limp, against her side. he looked down at her for a mo- ment, pale, pained, desiring, and ashamed of his desire. he was not worthy, not ... their eyes for a moment met. what treasures hers promised! a queen's ransom of temperament. hastily he looked away, disengaged his imprisoned arm. he was obscurely terrified lest she should cease to be something he could feel himself unworthy of. \"i don't think you ought to see things like that,\" he said, making haste to transfer from lenina herself to the surrounding circumstances the blame for any past or possible future lapse from perfection. \"things like what, john?\" \"like this horrible film.\" \"horrible?\" lenina was genuinely astonished. \"but i thought it was lovely.\" \"it was base,\" he said indignantly, \"it was ignoble.\" she shook her head. \"i don't know what you mean.\" why was he so queer? why did he go out of his way to spoil things? in the taxicopter he hardly even looked at her. bound by strong vows that had never been pronounced, obedient to laws that had long since ceased to run, he sat averted and in silence. sometimes, as though a finger had plucked at some taut, almost breaking string, his whole body would shake with a sudden nervous start. the taxicopter landed on the roof of lenina's apartment house. \"at last,\" she thought exultantly as she stepped out of the cab. at last- even though he had been so queer just now. standing under a lamp, she peered into her hand mirror. at last. yes, her nose was a bit shiny. she shook the loose powder from her puff. while he was paying off the taxi-there would just be time. she rubbed at the shininess, thinking: \"he's terribly good-looking. no need for him to be shy like bernard. and yet ... any other man would have done it long ago. well, now at last.\" that fragment of a face in the little round mirror suddenly smiled at her. \"good-night,\" said a strangled voice behind her. lenina wheeled round. he was standing in the doorway of the cab, his eyes fixed, staring; had evidently been staring all this time while she was powdering her nose, waiting-but what for? or hesitating, trying to make up his mind, and all the time thinking, thinking-she could not imagine what extraordi- nary thoughts. \"good-night, lenina,\" he repeated, and made a strange grimacing attempt to smile. \"but, john ... i thought you were ... i mean, aren't you? ...\" he shut the door and bent forward to say something to the driver. the cab shot up into the air. looking down through the window in the floor, the savage could see lenina's upturned face, pale in the bluish light of the lamps. the mouth was open, she was calling. her foreshortened figure rushed away from him; the diminishing square of the roof seemed to be falling through the darkness. five minutes later he was back in his room. from its hiding-place he took out his mouse-nibbled volume, turned with religious care its stained and crumbled pages, and began to read othello. othello, he remembered, was like the hero of three weeks in a helicopter-a black man. drying her eyes, lenina walked across the roof to the lift. on her way down to the twenty-seventh floor she pulled out her soma bottle. one gramme, she decided, would not be enough; hers had been more than a one-gramme affliction. but if she took two grammes, she ran the risk of not waking up in time to-morrow morning. she compromised and, into her cupped left palm, shook out three half-gramme tablets. chapter twelve bernard had to shout through the locked door; the savage would not open. \"but everybody's there, waiting for you.\" \"let them wait,\" came back the muffled voice through the door. \"but you know quite well, john\" (how difficult it is to sound persuasive at the top of one's voice!) \"i asked them on purpose to meet you.\" \"you ought to have asked me first whether i wanted to meet them.\" \"but you always came before, john.\" \"that's precisely why i don't want to come again.\" \"just to please me,\" bernard bellowingly wheedled. \"won't you come to please me?\" \"no.\" \"do you seriously mean it?\" \"yes.\" despairingly, \"but what shall i do?\" bernard wailed. \"go to hell!\" bawled the exasperated voice from within. \"but the arch-community-songster of canterbury is there to-night.\" bernard was almost in tears. \"ai yaa takwa!\" it was only in zuni that the savage could adequately express what he felt about the arch-community-songster. \"hani!\" he added as an after-thought; and then (with what derisive ferocity!): \"sons eso tse-na.\" and he spat on the ground, as pope might have done. in the end bernard had to slink back, diminished, to his rooms and in- form the impatient assembly that the savage would not be appearing that evening. the news was received with indignation. the men were furious at having been tricked into behaving politely to this insignifi- cant fellow with the unsavoury reputation and the heretical opinions. the higher their position in the hierarchy, the deeper their resentment. \"to play such a joke on me,\" the arch-songster kept repeating, \"on me!\" as for the women, they indignantly felt that they had been had on false pretences-had by a wretched little man who had had alcohol poured into his bottle by mistake-by a creature with a gamma-minus physique. it was an outrage, and they said so, more and more loudly. the head mistress of eton was particularly scathing. lenina alone said nothing. pale, her blue eyes clouded with an un- wonted melancholy, she sat in a corner, cut off from those who sur- rounded her by an emotion which they did not share. she had come to the party filled with a strange feeling of anxious exultation. \"in a few minutes,\" she had said to herself, as she entered the room, \"i shall be seeing him, talking to him, telling him\" (for she had come with her mind made up) \"that i like him-more than anybody i've ever known. and then perhaps he'll say ...\" what would he say? the blood had rushed to her cheeks. \"why was he so strange the other night, after the feelies? so queer. and yet i'm absolutely sure he really does rather like me. i'm sure ...\" it was at this moment that bernard had made his announcement; the savage wasn't coming to the party. lenina suddenly felt all the sensations normally experienced at the be- ginning of a violent passion surrogate treatment-a sense of dreadful emptiness, a breathless apprehension, a nausea. her heart seemed to stop beating. \"perhaps it's because he doesn't like me,\" she said to herself. and at once this possibility became an established certainty: john had refused to come because he didn't like her. he didn't like her. ... \"it really is a bit too thick,\" the head mistress of eton was saying to the director of crematoria and phosphorus reclamation. \"when i think that i actually ...\" \"yes,\" came the voice of fanny crowne, \"it's absolutely true about the alcohol. some one i know knew some one who was working in the embryo store at the time. she said to my friend, and my friend said to me ...\" \"too bad, too bad,\" said henry foster, sympathizing with the arch- community-songster. \"it may interest you to know that our ex- director was on the point of transferring him to iceland.\" pierced by every word that was spoken, the tight balloon of bernard's happy self-confidence was leaking from a thousand wounds. pale, dis- traught, abject and agitated, he moved among his guests, stammering incoherent apologies, assuring them that next time the savage would certainly be there, begging them to sit down and take a carotene sandwich, a slice of vitamin a pate, a glass of champagne-surrogate. they duly ate, but ignored him; drank and were either rude to his face or talked to one another about him, loudly and offensively, as though he had not been there. \"and now, my friends,\" said the arch-community-songster of canter- bury, in that beautiful ringing voice with which he led the proceedings at ford's day celebrations, \"now, my friends, i think perhaps the time has come ...\" he rose, put down his glass, brushed from his purple vis- cose waistcoat the crumbs of a considerable collation, and walked to- wards the door. bernard darted forward to intercept him. \"must you really, arch-songster? ... it's very early still. i'd hoped you would ...\" yes, what hadn't he hoped, when lenina confidentially told him that the arch-community-songster would accept an invitation if it were sent. \"he's really rather sweet, you know.\" and she had shown ber- nard the little golden zipper-fastening in the form of a t which the arch-songster had given her as a memento of the week-end she had spent at lambeth. to meet the arch-community-songster of canter- bury and mr. savage. bernard had proclaimed his triumph on every in- vitation card. but the savage had chosen this evening of all evenings to lock himself up in his room, to shout \"hani!\" and even (it was lucky that bernard didn't understand zuni) \"sons eso tse-na!\" what should have been the crowning moment of bernard's whole career had turned out to be the moment of his greatest humiliation. \"i'd so much hoped ...\" he stammeringly repeated, looking up at the great dignitary with pleading and distracted eyes. \"my young friend,\" said the arch-community-songster in a tone of loud and solemn severity; there was a general silence. \"let me give you a word of advice.\" he wagged his finger at bernard. \"before it's too late. a word of good advice.\" (his voice became sepulchral.) \"mend your ways, my young friend, mend your ways.\" he made the sign of the t over him and turned away. \"lenina, my dear,\" he called in an- other tone. \"come with me.\" obediently, but unsmiling and (wholly insensible of the honour done to her) without elation, lenina walked after him, out of the room. the other guests followed at a respectful interval. the last of them slammed the door. bernard was all alone. punctured, utterly deflated, he dropped into a chair and, covering his face with his hands, began to weep. a few minutes later, however, he thought better of it and took four tablets of soma. upstairs in his room the savage was reading romeo and juliet. lenina and the arch-community-songster stepped out on to the roof of lambeth palace. \"hurry up, my young friend-i mean, lenina,\" called the arch-songster impatiently from the lift gates. lenina, who had lingered for a moment to look at the moon, dropped her eyes and came hurrying across the roof to rejoin him. \"a new theory of biology\" was the title of the paper which mustapha mond had just finished reading. he sat for some time, meditatively frowning, then picked up his pen and wrote across the title-page: \"the author's mathematical treatment of the conception of purpose is novel and highly ingenious, but heretical and, so far as the present social or- der is concerned, dangerous and potentially subversive. not to be pub- lished.\" he underlined the words. \"the author will be kept under su- pervision. his transference to the marine biological station of st. he- lena may become necessary.\" a pity, he thought, as he signed his name. it was a masterly piece of work. but once you began admitting explanations in terms of purpose-well, you didn't know what the result might be. it was the sort of idea that might easily decondition the more unsettled minds among the higher castes-make them lose their faith in happiness as the sovereign good and take to believing, in- stead, that the goal was somewhere beyond, somewhere outside the present human sphere, that the purpose of life was not the mainte- nance of well-being, but some intensification and refining of con- sciousness, some enlargement of knowledge. which was, the control- ler reflected, quite possibly true. but not, in the present circumstance, admissible. he picked up his pen again, and under the words \"not to be published\" drew a second line, thicker and blacker than the first; then sighed, \"what fun it would be,\" he thought, \"if one didn't have to think about happiness!\" with closed eyes, his face shining with rapture, john was softly de- claiming to vacancy: \"oh! she doth teach the torches to burn bright. it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night, like a rich jewel in an ethiop's ear; beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear ...\" the golden t lay shining on lenina's bosom. sportively, the arch- community-songster caught hold of it, sportively he pulled, pulled. \"i think,\" said lenina suddenly, breaking a long silence, \"i'd better take a couple of grammes of soma.\" bernard, by this time, was fast asleep and smiling at the private para- dise of his dreams. smiling, smiling. but inexorably, every thirty sec- onds, the minute hand of the electric clock above his bed jumped for- ward with an almost imperceptible click. click, click, click, click ... and it was morning. bernard was back among the miseries of space and time. it was in the lowest spirits that he taxied across to his work at the conditioning centre. the intoxication of success had evaporated; he was soberly his old self; and by contrast with the temporary balloon of these last weeks, the old self seemed unprecedentedly heavier than the surrounding atmosphere. to this deflated bernard the savage showed himself unexpectedly sympathetic. \"you're more like what you were at malpais,\" he said, when bernard had told him his plaintive story. \"do you remember when we first talked together? outside the little house. you're like what you were then.\" \"because i'm unhappy again; that's why.\" \"well, i'd rather be unhappy than have the sort of false, lying happi- ness you were having here.\" \"i like that,\" said bernard bitterly. \"when it's you who were the cause of it all. refusing to come to my party and so turning them all against me!\" he knew that what he was saying was absurd in its injustice; he admitted inwardly, and at last even aloud, the truth of all that the savage now said about the worthlessness of friends who could be turned upon so slight a provocation into persecuting enemies. but in spite of this knowledge and these admissions, in spite of the fact that his friend's support and sympathy were now his only comfort, bernard continued perversely to nourish, along with his quite genuine affection, a secret grievance against the savage, to mediate a campaign of small revenges to be wreaked upon him. nourishing a grievance against the arch-community-songster was useless; there was no possibility of be- ing revenged on the chief bottler or the assistant predestinator. as a victim, the savage possessed, for bernard, this enormous superiority over the others: that he was accessible. one of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies. bernard's other victim-friend was helmholtz. when, discomfited, he came and asked once more for the friendship which, in his prosperity, he had not thought it worth his while to preserve. helmholtz gave it; and gave it without a reproach, without a comment, as though he had forgotten that there had ever been a quarrel. touched, bernard felt himself at the same time humiliated by this magnanimity-a magna- nimity the more extraordinary and therefore the more humiliating in that it owed nothing to soma and everything to helmholtz's character. it was the helmholtz of daily life who forgot and forgave, not the helmholtz of a half-gramme holiday. bernard was duly grateful (it was an enormous comfort to have his friend again) and also duly resentful (it would be pleasure to take some revenge on helmholtz for his gen- erosity). at their first meeting after the estrangement, bernard poured out the tale of his miseries and accepted consolation. it was not till some days later that he learned, to his surprise and with a twinge of shame, that he was not the only one who had been in trouble. helmholtz had also come into conflict with authority. \"it was over some rhymes,\" he explained. \"i was giving my usual course of advanced emotional engineering for third year students. twelve lectures, of which the seventh is about rhymes. 'on the use of rhymes in moral propaganda and advertisement,' to be precise. i al- ways illustrate my lecture with a lot of technical examples. this time i thought i'd give them one i'd just written myself. pure madness, of course; but i couldn't resist it.\" he laughed. \"i was curious to see what their reactions would be. besides,\" he added more gravely, \"i wanted to do a bit of propaganda; i was trying to engineer them into feeling as i'd felt when i wrote the rhymes. ford!\" he laughed again. \"what an outcry there was! the principal had me up and threatened to hand me the immediate sack. i'm a marked man.\" \"but what were your rhymes?\" bernard asked. \"they were about being alone.\" bernard's eyebrows went up. \"i'll recite them to you, if you like.\" and helmholtz began: \"yesterday's committee, sticks, but a broken drum, midnight in the city, flutes in a vacuum, shut lips, sleeping faces, every stopped machine, the dumb and littered places where crowds have been: ... all silences rejoice, weep (loudly or low), speak-but with the voice of whom, i do not know. absence, say, of susan's, absence of egeria 's arms and respective bosoms, lips and, ah, posteriors, slowly form a presence; whose? and, i ask, of what so absurd an essence, that something, which is not, nevertheless should populate empty night more solidly than that with which we copulate, why should it seem so squalidly? well, i gave them that as an example, and they reported me to the principal.\" \"i'm not surprised,\" said bernard. \"it's flatly against all their sleep- teaching. remember, they've had at least a quarter of a million warn- ings against solitude.\" \"i know. but i thought i'd like to see what the effect would be.\" \"well, you've seen now.\" helmholtz only laughed. \"i feel,\" he said, after a silence, as though i were just beginning to have something to write about. as though i were beginning to be able to use that power i feel i've got inside me- that extra, latent power. something seems to be coming to me.\" in spite of all his troubles, he seemed, bernard thought, profoundly happy. helmholtz and the savage took to one another at once. so cordially indeed that bernard felt a sharp pang of jealousy. in all these weeks he had never come to so close an intimacy with the savage as helm- holtz immediately achieved. watching them, listening to their talk, he found himself sometimes resentfully wishing that he had never brought them together. he was ashamed of his jealousy and alter- nately made efforts of will and took soma to keep himself from feeling it. but the efforts were not very successful; and between the soma- holidays there were, of necessity, intervals. the odious sentiment kept on returning. at his third meeting with the savage, helmholtz recited his rhymes on solitude. \"what do you think of them?\" he asked when he had done. the savage shook his head. \"listen to this,\" was his answer; and un- locking the drawer in which he kept his mouse-eaten book, he opened and read: \"let the bird of loudest lay on the sole arabian tree, herald sad and trumpet be ...\" helmholtz listened with a growing excitement. at \"sole arabian tree\" he started; at \"thou shrieking harbinger\" he smiled with sudden pleas- ure; at \"every fowl of tyrant wing\" the blood rushed up into his cheeks; but at \"defunctive music\" he turned pale and trembled with an unprecedented emotion. the savage read on: \"property was thus appall'd, that the self was not the same; single nature's double name neither two nor one was call'd reason in itself confounded saw division grow together ...\" \"orgy-porgy!\" said bernard, interrupting the reading with a loud, un- pleasant laugh. \"it's just a solidarity service hymn.\" he was revenging himself on his two friends for liking one another more than they liked him. in the course of their next two or three meetings he frequently re- peated this little act of vengeance. it was simple and, since both helmholtz and the savage were dreadfully pained by the shattering and defilement of a favourite poetic crystal, extremely effective. in the end, helmholtz threatened to kick him out of the room if he dared to interrupt again. and yet, strangely enough, the next interruption, the most disgraceful of all, came from helmholtz himself. the savage was reading romeo and juliet aloud-reading (for all the time he was seeing himself as romeo and lenina as juliet) with an in- tense and quivering passion. helmholtz had listened to the scene of the lovers' first meeting with a puzzled interest. the scene in the or- chard had delighted him with its poetry; but the sentiments expressed had made him smile. getting into such a state about having a girl-it seemed rather ridiculous. but, taken detail by verbal detail, what a su- perb piece of emotional engineering! \"that old fellow,\" he said, \"he makes our best propaganda technicians look absolutely silly.\" the sav- age smiled triumphantly and resumed his reading. all went tolerably well until, in the last scene of the third act, capulet and lady capulet began to bully juliet to marry paris. helmholtz had been restless throughout the entire scene; but when, pathetically mimed by the savage, juliet cried out: \"is there no pity sitting in the clouds, that sees into the bottom of my grief? o sweet my mother, cast me not away: delay this marriage for a month, a week; or, if you do not, make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies ...\" when juliet said this, helmholtz broke out in an explosion of uncontrol- lable guffawing. the mother and father (grotesque obscenity) forcing the daughter to have some one she didn't want! and the idiotic girl not saying that she was having some one else whom (for the moment, at any rate) she preferred! in its smutty absurdity the situation was irresistibly comical. he had managed, with a heroic effort, to hold down the mounting pressure of his hilarity; but \"sweet mother\" (in the savage's tremulous tone of anguish) and the reference to tybalt lying dead, but evidently uncremated and wasting his phosphorus on a dim monument, were too much for him. he laughed and laughed till the tears streamed down his face-quenchlessly laughed while, pale with a sense of out- rage, the savage looked at him over the top of his book and then, as the laughter still continued, closed it indignantly, got up and, with the gesture of one who removes his pearl from before swine, locked it away in its drawer. \"and yet,\" said helmholtz when, having recovered breath enough to apologize, he had mollified the savage into listening to his explana- tions, \"i know quite well that one needs ridiculous, mad situations like that; one can't write really well about anything else. why was that old fellow such a marvellous propaganda technician? because he had so many insane, excruciating things to get excited about. you've got to be hurt and upset; otherwise you can't think of the really good, penetrat- ing, x-rayish phrases. but fathers and mothers!\" he shook his head. \"you can't expect me to keep a straight face about fathers and moth- ers. and who's going to get excited about a boy having a girl or not having her?\" (the savage winced; but helmholtz, who was staring pensively at the floor, saw nothing.) \"no.\" he concluded, with a sigh, \"it won't do. we need some other kind of madness and violence. but what? what? where can one find it?\" he was silent; then, shaking his head, \"i don't know,\" he said at last, \"i don't know.\" chapter thirteen henry foster loomed up through the twilight of the embryo store. \"like to come to a feely this evening?\" lenina shook her head without speaking. \"going out with some one else?\" it interested him to know which of his friends was being had by which other. \"is it benito?\" he questioned. she shook her head again. henry detected the weariness in those purple eyes, the pallor beneath that glaze of lupus, the sadness at the corners of the unsmiling crim- son mouth. \"you're not feeling ill, are you?\" he asked, a trifle anx- iously, afraid that she might be suffering from one of the few remain- ing infectious diseases. yet once more lenina shook her head. \"anyhow, you ought to go and see the doctor,\" said henry. \"a doctor a day keeps the jim-jams away,\" he added heartily, driving home his hypnopaedic adage with a clap on the shoulder. \"perhaps you need a pregnancy substitute,\" he suggested. \"or else an extra-strong v.p.s. treatment. sometimes, you know, the standard passion surrogate isn't quite ...\" \"oh, for ford's sake,\" said lenina, breaking her stubborn silence, \"shut up!\" and she turned back to her neglected embryos. a v.p.s. treatment indeed! she would have laughed, if she hadn't been on the point of crying. as though she hadn't got enough v. p. of her own! she sighed profoundly as she refilled her syringe. \"john,\" she murmured to herself, \"john ...\" then \"my ford,\" she wondered, \"have i given this one its sleeping sickness injection, or haven't i?\" she simply couldn't remember. in the end, she decided not to run the risk of let- ting it have a second dose, and moved down the line to the next bot- tle. twenty-two years, eight months, and four days from that moment, a promising young alpha-minus administrator at mwanza-mwanza was to die of trypanosomiasis-the first case for over half a century. sighing, lenina went on with her work. an hour later, in the changing room, fanny was energetically protest- ing. \"but it's absurd to let yourself get into a state like this. simply ab- surd,\" she repeated. \"and what about? a man-one man.\" \"but he's the one i want.\" \"as though there weren't millions of other men in the world.\" \"but i don't want them.\" \"how can you know till you've tried?\" \"i have tried.\" \"but how many?\" asked fanny, shrugging her shoulders contemptu- ously. \"one, two?\" \"dozens. but,\" shaking her head, \"it wasn't any good,\" she added. \"well, you must persevere,\" said fanny sententiously. but it was obvi- ous that her confidence in her own prescriptions had been shaken. \"nothing can be achieved without perseverance.\" \"but meanwhile ...\" \"don't think of him.\" \"i can't help it.\" \"take soma, then.\" \"i do.\" \"well, go on.\" \"but in the intervals i still like him. i shall always like him.\" \"well, if that's the case,\" said fanny, with decision, \"why don't you just go and take him. whether he wants it or no.\" \"but if you knew how terribly queer he was!\" \"all the more reason for taking a firm line.\" \"it's all very well to say that.\" \"don't stand any nonsense. act.\" fanny's voice was a trumpet; she might have been a y.w.f.a. lecturer giving an evening talk to adoles- cent beta-minuses. \"yes, act-at once. do it now.\" \"i'd be scared,\" said lenina \"well, you've only got to take half a gramme of soma first. and now i'm going to have my bath.\" she marched off, trailing her towel. the bell rang, and the savage, who was impatiently hoping that helm- holtz would come that afternoon (for having at last made up his mind to talk to helmholtz about lenina, he could not bear to postpone his confidences a moment longer), jumped up and ran to the door. \"i had a premonition it was you, helmholtz,\" he shouted as he opened. on the threshold, in a white acetate-satin sailor suit, and with a round white cap rakishly tilted over her left ear, stood lenina. \"oh!\" said the savage, as though some one had struck him a heavy blow. half a gramme had been enough to make lenina forget her fears and her embarrassments. \"hullo, john,\" she said, smiling, and walked past him into the room. automatically he closed the door and followed her. lenina sat down. there was a long silence. \"you don't seem very glad to see me, john,\" she said at last. \"not glad?\" the savage looked at her reproachfully; then suddenly fell on his knees before her and, taking lenina's hand, reverently kissed it. \"not glad? oh, if you only knew,\" he whispered and, venturing to raise his eyes to her face, \"admired lenina,\" he went on, \"indeed the top of admiration, worth what's dearest in the world.\" she smiled at him with a luscious tenderness. \"oh, you so perfect\" (she was leaning towards him with parted lips), \"so perfect and so peerless are created\" (nearer and nearer) \"of every creature's best.\" still nearer. the savage sud- denly scrambled to his feet. \"that's why,\" he said speaking with averted face, \"i wanted to do something first ... i mean, to show i was worthy of you. not that i could ever really be that. but at any rate to show i wasn't absolutely i/n-worthy. i wanted to do something.\" \"why should you think it necessary ...\" lenina began, but left the sen- tence unfinished. there was a note of irritation in her voice. when one has leant forward, nearer and nearer, with parted lips-only to find oneself, quite suddenly, as a clumsy oaf scrambles to his feet, leaning towards nothing at all-well, there is a reason, even with half a gramme of soma circulating in one's blood-stream, a genuine reason for annoyance. \"at malpais,\" the savage was incoherently mumbling, \"you had to bring her the skin of a mountain lion-i mean, when you wanted to marry some one. or else a wolf.\" \"there aren't any lions in england,\" lenina almost snapped. \"and even if there were,\" the savage added, with sudden contemptu- ous resentment, \"people would kill them out of helicopters, i suppose, with poison gas or something. i wouldn't do that, lenina.\" he squared his shoulders, he ventured to look at her and was met with a stare of annoyed incomprehension. confused, \"i'll do anything,\" he went on, more and more incoherently. \"anything you tell me. there be some sports are painful-you know. but their labour delight in them sets off. that's what i feel. i mean i'd sweep the floor if you wanted.\" \"but we've got vacuum cleaners here,\" said lenina in bewilderment. \"it isn't necessary.\" \"no, of course it isn't necessary. but some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone. i'd like to undergo something nobly. don't you see?\" \"but if there are vacuum cleaners ...\" \"that's not the point.\" \"and epsilon semi-morons to work them,\" she went on, \"well, really, why?\" \"why? but for you, for you. just to show that i ...\" \"and what on earth vacuum cleaners have got to do with lions ...\" \"to show how much ...\" \"or lions with being glad to see me ...\" she was getting more and more exasperated. \"how much i love you, lenina,\" he brought out almost desperately. an emblem of the inner tide of startled elation, the blood rushed up into lenina's cheeks. \"do you mean it, john?\" \"but i hadn't meant to say so,\" cried the savage, clasping his hands in a kind of agony. \"not until ... listen, lenina; in malpais people get mar- ried.\" \"get what?\" the irritation had begun to creep back into her voice. what was he talking about now? \"for always. they make a promise to live together for always.\" \"what a horrible idea!\" lenina was genuinely shocked. \"outliving beauty's outward with a mind that cloth renew swifter than blood decays.\" \"what?\" \"it's like that in shakespeare too. 'if thou cost break her virgin knot before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite ...'\" \"for ford's sake, john, talk sense. i can't understand a word you say. first it's vacuum cleaners; then it's knots. you're driving me crazy.\" she jumped up and, as though afraid that he might run away from her physically, as well as with his mind, caught him by the wrist. \"answer me this question: do you really like me, or don't you?\" there was a moment's silence; then, in a very low voice, \"i love you more than anything in the world,\" he said. \"then why on earth didn't you say so?\" she cried, and so intense was her exasperation that she drove her sharp nails into the skin of his wrist. \"instead of drivelling away about knots and vacuum cleaners and lions, and making me miserable for weeks and weeks.\" she released his hand and flung it angrily away from her. \"if i didn't like you so much,\" she said, \"i'd be furious with you.\" and suddenly her arms were round his neck; he felt her lips soft against his own. so deliciously soft, so warm and electric that inevita- bly he found himself thinking of the embraces in three weeks in a helicopter. ooh! ooh! the stereoscopic blonde and anh! the more than real blackamoor. horror, horror, horror ... he fired to disengage himself; but lenina tightened her embrace. \"why didn't you say so?\" she whispered, drawing back her face to look at him. her eyes were tenderly reproachful. \"the murkiest den, the most opportune place\" (the voice of conscience thundered poetically), \"the strongest suggestion our worser genius can, shall never melt mine honour into lust. never, never!\" he re- solved. \"you silly boy!\" she was saying. \"i wanted you so much. and if you wanted me too, why didn't you? ...\" \"but, lenina ...\" he began protesting; and as she immediately untwined her arms, as she stepped away from him, he thought, for a moment, that she had taken his unspoken hint. but when she unbuckled her white patent cartridge belt and hung it carefully over the back of a chair, he began to suspect that he had been mistaken. \"lenina!\" he repeated apprehensively. she put her hand to her neck and gave a long vertical pull; her white sailor's blouse was ripped to the hem; suspicion condensed into a too, too solid certainty. \"lenina, what are you doing?\" zip, zip! her answer was wordless. she stepped out of her bell- bottomed trousers. her zippicamiknicks were a pale shell pink. the arch-community-songster's golden t dangled at her breast. \"for those milk paps that through the window bars bore at men's eyes....\" the singing, thundering, magical words made her seem dou- bly dangerous, doubly alluring. soft, soft, but how piercing! boring and drilling into reason, tunnelling through resolution. \"the strongest oaths are straw to the fire i' the blood. be more abstemious, or else ...\" zip! the rounded pinkness fell apart like a neatly divided apple. a wriggle of the arms, a lifting first of the right foot, then the left: the zippicamiknicks were lying lifeless and as though deflated on the floor. still wearing her shoes and socks, and her rakishly tilted round white cap, she advanced towards him. \"darling. darling! if only you'd said so before!\" she held out her arms. but instead of also saying \"darling!\" and holding out his arms, the savage retreated in terror, flapping his hands at her as though he were trying to scare away some intruding and dangerous animal. four backwards steps, and he was brought to bay against the wall. \"sweet!\" said lenina and, laying her hands on his shoulders, pressed herself against him. \"put your arms round me,\" she commanded. \"hug me till you drug me, honey.\" she too had poetry at her command, knew words that sang and were spells and beat drums. \"kiss me\"; she closed her eyes, she let her voice sink to a sleepy murmur, \"kiss me till i'm in a coma. hug me, honey, snuggly ...\" the savage caught her by the wrists, tore her hands from his shoul- ders, thrust her roughly away at arm's length. \"ow, you're hurting me, you're ... oh!\" she was suddenly silent. terror had made her forget the pain. opening her eyes, she had seen his face-no, not his face, a ferocious stranger's, pale, distorted, twitching with some insane, inexplicable fury. aghast, \"but what is it, john?\" she whispered. he did not answer, but only stared into her face with those mad eyes. the hands that held her wrists were trembling. he breathed deeply and irregularly. faint almost to imperceptibility, but appalling, she suddenly heard the grinding of his teeth. \"what is it?\" she almost screamed. and as though awakened by her cry he caught her by the shoulders and shook her. \"whore!\" he shouted \"whore! impudent strumpet!\" \"oh, don't, do-on't,\" she protested in a voice made grotesquely tremu- lous by his shaking. \"whore!\" \"plea-ease.\" \"damned whore!\" \"a gra-amme is be-etter ...\" she began. the savage pushed her away with such force that she staggered and fell. \"go,\" he shouted, standing over her menacingly, \"get out of my sight or i'll kill you.\" he clenched his fists. lenina raised her arm to cover her face. \"no, please don't, john ...\" \"hurry up. quick!\" one arm still raised, and following his every movement with a terrified eye, she scrambled to her feet and still crouching, still covering her head, made a dash for the bathroom. the noise of that prodigious slap by which her departure was acceler- ated was like a pistol shot. \"ow!\" lenina bounded forward. safely locked into the bathroom, she had leisure to take stock of her injuries. standing with her back to the mirror, she twisted her head. looking over her left shoulder she could see the imprint of an open hand standing out distinct and crimson on the pearly flesh. gingerly she rubbed the wounded spot. outside, in the other room, the savage was striding up and down, marching, marching to the drums and music of magical words. \"the wren goes to't and the small gilded fly does lecher in my sight.\" mad- deningly they rumbled in his ears. \"the fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't with a more riotous appetite. down from the waist they are centaurs, though women all above. but to the girdle do the gods in- herit. beneath is all the fiend's. there's hell, there's darkness, there is the sulphurous pit, burning scalding, stench, consumption; fie, fie, fie, pain, pain! give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination.\" \"john!\" ventured a small ingratiating voice from the bathroom. \"john!\" \"o thou weed, who are so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet that the sense aches at thee. was this most goodly book made to write 'whore' upon? heaven stops the nose at it ...\" but her perfume still hung about him, his jacket was white with the powder that had scented her velvety body. \"impudent strumpet, im- pudent strumpet, impudent strumpet.\" the inexorable rhythm beat it- self out. \"impudent ...\" \"john, do you think i might have my clothes?\" he picked up the bell-bottomed trousers, the blouse, the zippicami- knicks. \"open!\" he ordered, kicking the door. \"no, i won't.\" the voice was frightened and defiant. \"well, how do you expect me to give them to you?\" \"push them through the ventilator over the door.\" he did what she suggested and returned to his uneasy pacing of the room. \"impudent strumpet, impudent strumpet. the devil luxury with his fat rump and potato finger ...\" \"john.\" he would not answer. \"fat rump and potato finger.\" \"john.\" \"what is it?\" he asked gruffly. \"i wonder if you'd mind giving me my malthusian belt.\" lenina sat, listening to the footsteps in the other room, wondering, as she listened, how long he was likely to go tramping up and down like that; whether she would have to wait until he left the flat; or if it would be safe, after allowing his madness a reasonable time to sub- side, to open the bathroom door and make a dash for it. she was interrupted in the midst of these uneasy speculations by the sound of the telephone bell ringing in the other room. abruptly the tramping ceased. she heard the voice of the savage parleying with si- lence. \"hullo.\" \"yes.\" \"if i do not usurp myself, i am.\" \"yes, didn't you hear me say so? mr. savage speaking.\" \"what? who's ill? of course it interests me.\" \"but is it serious? is she really bad? i'll go at once ...\" \"not in her rooms any more? where has she been taken?' \"oh, my god! what's the address?\" \"three park lane-is that it? three? thanks.\" lenina heard the click of the replaced receiver, then hurrying steps. a door slammed. there was silence. was he really gone? with an infinity of precautions she opened the door a quarter of an inch; peeped through the crack; was encouraged by the view of emp- tiness; opened a little further, and put her whole head out; finally tip- toed into the room; stood for a few seconds with strongly beating heart, listening, listening; then darted to the front door, opened, slipped through, slammed, ran. it was not till she was in the lift and actually dropping down the well that she began to feel herself secure. chapter fourteen the park lane hospital for the dying was a sixty-story tower of prim- rose tiles. as the savage stepped out of his taxicopter a convoy of gaily-coloured aerial hearses rose whirring from the roof and darted away across the park, westwards, bound for the slough crematorium. at the lift gates the presiding porter gave him the information he re- quired, and he dropped down to ward 81 (a galloping senility ward, the porter explained) on the seventeenth floor. it was a large room bright with sunshine and yellow paint, and con- taining twenty beds, all occupied. linda was dying in company-in company and with all the modern conveniences. the air was continu- ously alive with gay synthetic melodies. at the foot of every bed, con- fronting its moribund occupant, was a television box. television was left on, a running tap, from morning till night. every quarter of an hour the prevailing perfume of the room was automatically changed. \"we try,\" explained the nurse, who had taken charge of the savage at the door, \"we try to create a thoroughly pleasant atmosphere here-some- thing between a first-class hotel and a feely-palace, if you take my meaning.\" \"where is she?\" asked the savage, ignoring these polite explanations. the nurse was offended. \"you are in a hurry,\" she said. \"is there any hope?\" he asked. \"you mean, of her not dying?\" (he nodded.) \"no, of course there isn't. when somebody's sent here, there's no ...\" startled by the expression of distress on his pale face, she suddenly broke off. \"why, whatever is the matter?\" she asked. she was not accustomed to this kind of thing in visitors. (not that there were many visitors anyhow: or any reason why there should be many visitors.) \"you're not feeling ill, are you?\" he shook his head. \"she's my mother,\" he said in a scarcely audible voice. the nurse glanced at him with startled, horrified eyes; then quickly looked away. from throat to temple she was all one hot blush. \"take me to her,\" said the savage, making an effort to speak in an or- dinary tone. still blushing, she led the way down the ward. faces still fresh and un- withered (for senility galloped so hard that it had no time to age the cheeks-only the heart and brain) turned as they passed. their pro- gress was followed by the blank, incurious eyes of second infancy. the savage shuddered as he looked. linda was lying in the last of the long row of beds, next to the wall. propped up on pillows, she was watching the semi-finals of the south american riemann-surface tennis championship, which were being played in silent and diminished reproduction on the screen of the tele- vision box at the foot of the bed. hither and thither across their square of illuminated glass the little figures noiselessly darted, like fish in an aquarium-the silent but agitated inhabitants of another world. linda looked on, vaguely and uncomprehendingly smiling. her pale, bloated face wore an expression of imbecile happiness. every now and then her eyelids closed, and for a few seconds she seemed to be doz- ing. then with a little start she would wake up again-wake up to the aquarium antics of the tennis champions, to the super-vox- wurlitzeriana rendering of \"hug me till you drug me, honey,\" to the warm draught of verbena that came blowing through the ventilator above her head-would wake to these things, or rather to a dream of which these things, transformed and embellished by the soma in her blood, were the marvellous constituents, and smile once more her broken and discoloured smile of infantile contentment. \"well, i must go,\" said the nurse. \"i've got my batch of children com- ing. besides, there's number 3.\" she pointed up the ward. \"might go off any minute now. well, make yourself comfortable.\" she walked briskly away. the savage sat down beside the bed. \"linda,\" he whispered, taking her hand. at the sound of her name, she turned. her vague eyes brightened with recognition. she squeezed his hand, she smiled, her lips moved; then quite suddenly her head fell forward. she was asleep. he sat watching her-seeking through the tired flesh, seeking and finding that young, bright face which had stooped over his childhood in malpais, remem- bering (and he closed his eyes) her voice, her movements, all the events of their life together. \"streptocock-gee to banbury t ...\" how beautiful her singing had been! and those childish rhymes, how magi- cally strange and mysterious! /a, b, c, vitamin d: the fat's in the liver, the cod's in the sea. he felt the hot tears welling up behind his eyelids as he recalled the words and linda's voice as she repeated them. and then the reading lessons: the tot is in the pot, the cat is on the mat; and the elemen- tary instructions for beta workers in the embryo store. and long eve- nings by the fire or, in summertime, on the roof of the little house, when she told him those stories about the other place, outside the reservation: that beautiful, beautiful other place, whose memory, as of a heaven, a paradise of goodness and loveliness, he still kept whole and intact, undefiled by contact with the reality of this real london, these actual civilized men and women. a sudden noise of shrill voices made him open his eyes and, after hastily brushing away the tears, look round. what seemed an intermi- nable stream of identical eight-year-old male twins was pouring into the room. twin after twin, twin after twin, they came-a nightmare. their faces, their repeated face-for there was only one between the lot of them-puggishly stared, all nostrils and pale goggling eyes. their uniform was khaki. all their mouths hung open. squealing and chatter- ing they entered. in a moment, it seemed, the ward was maggoty with them. they swarmed between the beds, clambered over, crawled un- der, peeped into the television boxes, made faces at the patients. linda astonished and rather alarmed them. a group stood clustered at the foot of her bed, staring with the frightened and stupid curiosity of animals suddenly confronted by the unknown. \"oh, look, look!\" they spoke in low, scared voices. \"whatever is the matter with her? why is she so fat?\" they had never seen a face like hers before-had never seen a face that was not youthful and taut-skinned, a body that had ceased to be slim and upright. all these moribund sexagenarians had the appear- ance of childish girls. at forty-four, linda seemed, by contrast, a mon- ster of flaccid and distorted senility. \"isn't she awful?\" came the whispered comments. \"look at her teeth!\" suddenly from under the bed a pug-faced twin popped up between john's chair and the wall, and began peering into linda's sleeping face. \"i say ...\" he began; but the sentence ended prematurely in a squeal. the savage had seized him by the collar, lifted him clear over the chair and, with a smart box on the ears, sent him howling away. his yells brought the head nurse hurrying to the rescue. \"what have you been doing to him?\" she demanded fiercely. \"i won't have you striking the children.\" \"well then, keep them away from this bed.\" the savage's voice was trembling with indignation. \"what are these filthy little brats doing here at all? it's disgraceful!\" \"disgraceful? but what do you mean? they're being death-conditioned. and i tell you,\" she warned him truculently, \"if i have any more of your interference with their conditioning, i'll send for the porters and have you thrown out.\" the savage rose to his feet and took a couple of steps towards her. his movements and the expression on his face were so menacing that the nurse fell back in terror. with a great effort he checked himself and, without speaking, turned away and sat down again by the bed. reassured, but with a dignity that was a trifle shrill and uncertain, \"i've warned you,\" said the nurse, \"i've warned you,\" said the nurse, \"so mind.\" still, she led the too inquisitive twins away and made them join in the game of hunt-the-zipper, which had been organized by one of her colleagues at the other end of the room. \"run along now and have your cup of caffeine solution, dear,\" she said to the other nurse. the exercise of authority restored her confidence, made her feel better. \"now children!\" she called. linda had stirred uneasily, had opened her eyes for a moment, looked vaguely around, and then once more dropped off to sleep. sitting be- side her, the savage tried hard to recapture his mood of a few minutes before. \"a, b, c, vitamin d,\" he repeated to himself, as though the words were a spell that would restore the dead past to life. but the spell was ineffective. obstinately the beautiful memories refused to rise; there was only a hateful resurrection of jealousies and uglinesses and miseries. pope with the blood trickling down from his cut shoulder; and linda hideously asleep, and the flies buzzing round the spilt mes- cal on the floor beside the bed; and the boys calling those names as she passed. ... ah, no, no! he shut his eyes, he shook his head in strenuous denial of these memories. \"a, b, c, vitamin d ...\" he tried to think of those times when he sat on her knees and she put her arms about him and sang, over and over again, rocking him, rocking him to sleep. \"a, b, c, vitamin d, vitamin d, vitamin d ...\" the super-vox-wurlitzeriana had risen to a sobbing crescendo; and suddenly the verbena gave place, in the scent-circulating system, to an intense patchouli. linda stirred, woke up, stared for a few seconds bewilderly at the semi-finalists, then, lifting her face, sniffed once or twice at the newly perfumed air and suddenly smiled-a smile of child- ish ecstasy. \"pope!\" she murmured, and closed her eyes. \"oh, i do so like it, i do ...\" she sighed and let herself sink back into the pillows. \"but, linda!\" the savage spoke imploringly, \"don't you know me?\" he had tried so hard, had done his very best; why wouldn't she allow him to forget? he squeezed her limp hand almost with violence, as though he would force her to come back from this dream of ignoble pleasures, from these base and hateful memories-back into the present, back into reality: the appalling present, the awful reality-but sublime, but significant, but desperately important precisely because of the immi- nence of that which made them so fearful. \"don't you know me, linda?\" he felt the faint answering pressure of her hand. the tears started into his eyes. he bent over her and kissed her. her lips moved. \"pope!\" she whispered again, and it was as though he had had a pailful of ordure thrown in his face. anger suddenly boiled up in him. balked for the second time, the pas- sion of his grief had found another outlet, was transformed into a pas- sion of agonized rage. \"but i'm john!\" he shouted. \"i'm john!\" and in his furious misery he actually caught her by the shoulder and shook her. linda's eyes fluttered open; she saw him, knew him-\"john!\"-but situ- ated the real face, the real and violent hands, in an imaginary world- among the inward and private equivalents of patchouli and the super- wurlitzer, among the transfigured memories and the strangely trans- posed sensations that constituted the universe of her dream. she knew him for john, her son, but fancied him an intruder into that paradisal malpais where she had been spending her soma-holiday with pope. he was angry because she liked pope, he was shaking her be- cause pope was there in the bed-as though there were something wrong, as though all civilized people didn't do the same. \"every one belongs to every ...\" her voice suddenly died into an almost inaudible breathless croaking. her mouth fell open: she made a desperate effort to fill her lungs with air. but it was as though she had forgotten how to breathe. she tried to cry out-but no sound came; only the terror of her staring eyes revealed what she was suffering. her hands went to her throat, then clawed at the air-the air she could no longer breathe, the air that, for her, had ceased to exist. the savage was on his feet, bent over her. \"what is it, linda? what is it?\" his voice was imploring; it was as though he were begging to be reassured. the look she gave him was charged with an unspeakable terror-with terror and, it seemed to him, reproach. she tried to raise herself in bed, but fell back on to the pillows. her face was horribly distorted, her lips blue. the savage turned and ran up the ward. \"quick, quick!\" he shouted. \"quick!\" standing in the centre of a ring of zipper-hunting twins, the head nurse looked round. the first moment's astonishment gave place al- most instantly to disapproval. \"don't shout! think of the little ones,\" she said, frowning. \"you might decondition ... but what are you doing?\" he had broken through the ring. \"be careful!\" a child was yelling. \"quick, quick!\" he caught her by the sleeve, dragged her after him. \"quick! something's happened. i've killed her.\" by the time they were back at the end of the ward linda was dead. the savage stood for a moment in frozen silence, then fell on his knees beside the bed and, covering his face with his hands, sobbed uncontrollably. the nurse stood irresolute, looking now at the kneeling figure by the bed (the scandalous exhibition!) and now (poor children!) at the twins who had stopped their hunting of the zipper and were staring from the other end of the ward, staring with all their eyes and nostrils at the shocking scene that was being enacted round bed 20. should she speak to him? try to bring him back to a sense of decency? remind him of where he was? of what fatal mischief he might do to these poor in- nocents? undoing all their wholesome death-conditioning with this dis- gusting outcry-as though death were something terrible, as though any one mattered as much as all that! it might give them the most disastrous ideas about the subject, might upset them into reacting in the entirely wrong, the utterly anti-social way. she stepped forward, she touched him on the shoulder. \"can't you be- have?\" she said in a low, angry voice. but, looking around, she saw that half a dozen twins were already on their feet and advancing down the ward. the circle was disintegrating. in another moment ... no, the risk was too great; the whole group might be put back six or seven months in its conditioning. she hurried back towards her menaced charges. \"now, who wants a chocolate eclair?\" she asked in a loud, cheerful tone. \"me!\" yelled the entire bokanovsky group in chorus. bed 20 was com- pletely forgotten. \"oh, god, god, god ...\" the savage kept repeating to himself. in the chaos of grief and remorse that filled his mind it was the one articulate word. \"god!\" he whispered it aloud. \"god ...\" \"whatever is he saying?\" said a voice, very near, distinct and shrill through the warblings of the super-wurlitzer. the savage violently started and, uncovering his face, looked round. five khaki twins, each with the stump of a long eclair in his right hand, and their identical faces variously smeared with liquid chocolate, were standing in a row, puggily goggling at him. they met his eyes and simultaneously grinned. one of them pointed with his eclair butt. \"is she dead?\" he asked. the savage stared at them for a moment in silence. then in silence he rose to his feet, in silence slowly walked towards the door. \"is she dead?\" repeated the inquisitive twin trotting at his side. the savage looked down at him and still without speaking pushed him away. the twin fell on the floor and at once began to howl. the savage did not even look round. chapter fifteen the menial staff of the park lane hospital for the dying consisted of one hundred and sixty-two deltas divided into two bokanovsky groups of eighty-four red headed female and seventy-eight dark dolycho- cephalic male twins, respectively. at six, when their working day was over, the two groups assembled in the vestibule of the hospital and were served by the deputy sub-bursar with their soma ration. from the lift the savage stepped out into the midst of them. but his mind was elsewhere-with death, with his grief, and his remorse; me- chanicaly, without consciousness of what he was doing, he began to shoulder his way through the crowd. \"who are you pushing? where do you think you're going?\" high, low, from a multitude of separate throats, only two voices squeaked or growled. repeated indefinitely, as though by a train of mirrors, two faces, one a hairless and freckled moon haloed in orange, the other a thin, beaked bird-mask, stubbly with two days' beard, turned angrily towards him. their words and, in his ribs, the sharp nudging of elbows, broke through his unawareness. he woke once more to external reality, looked round him, knew what he saw-knew it, with a sinking sense of horror and disgust, for the recurrent delir- ium of his days and nights, the nightmare of swarming indistinguish- able sameness. twins, twins. ... like maggots they had swarmed defil- ingly over the mystery of linda's death. maggots again, but larger, full grown, they now crawled across his grief and his repentance. he halted and, with bewildered and horrified eyes, stared round him at the khaki mob, in the midst of which, overtopping it by a full head, he stood. \"how many goodly creatures are there here!\" the singing words mocked him derisively. \"how beauteous mankind is! o brave new world ...\" \"soma distribution!\" shouted a loud voice. \"in good order, please. hurry up there.\" a door had been opened, a table and chair carried into the vestibule. the voice was that of a jaunty young alpha, who had entered carrying a black iron cash-box. a murmur of satisfaction went up from the ex- pectant twins. they forgot all about the savage. their attention was now focused on the black cash-box, which the young man had placed on the table, and was now in process of unlocking. the lid was lifted. \"oo-oh!\" said all the hundred and sixty-two simultaneously, as though they were looking at fireworks. the young man took out a handful of tiny pill-boxes. \"now,\" he said peremptorily, \"step forward, please. one at a time, and no shoving.\" one at a time, with no shoving, the twins stepped forward. first two males, then a female, then another male, then three females, then ... the savage stood looking on. \"o brave new world, o brave new world ...\" in his mind the singing words seemed to change their tone. they had mocked him through his misery and remorse, mocked him with how hideous a note of cynical derision! fiendishly laughing, they had insisted on the low squalor, the nauseous ugliness of the nightmare. now, suddenly, they trumpeted a call to arms. \"o brave new world!\" miranda was proclaiming the possibility of loveliness, the possibility of transforming even the nightmare into something fine and noble. \"o brave new world!\" it was a challenge, a command. \"no shoving there now!\" shouted the deputy sub-bursar in a fury. he slammed down he lid of his cash-box. \"i shall stop the distribution un- less i have good behaviour.\" the deltas muttered, jostled one another a little, and then were still. the threat had been effective. deprivation of soma-appalling thought! \"that's better,\" said the young man, and reopened his cash-box. linda had been a slave, linda had died; others should live in freedom, and the world be made beautiful. a reparation, a duty. and suddenly it was luminously clear to the savage what he must do; it was as though a shutter had been opened, a curtain drawn back. \"now,\" said the deputy sub-bursar. another khaki female stepped forward. \"stop!\" called the savage in a loud and ringing voice. \"stop!\" he pushed his way to the table; the deltas stared at him with aston- ishment. \"ford!\" said the deputy sub-bursar, below his breath. \"it's the sav- age.\" he felt scared. \"listen, i beg of you,\" cried the savage earnestly. \"lend me your ears ...\" he had never spoken in public before, and found it very difficult to express what he wanted to say. \"don't take that horrible stuff. it's poi- son, it's poison.\" \"i say, mr. savage,\" said the deputy sub-bursar, smiling propitiatingly. \"would you mind letting me ...\" \"poison to soul as well as body.\" \"yes, but let me get on with my distribution, won't you? there's a good fellow.\" with the cautious tenderness of one who strokes a notoriously vicious animal, he patted the savage's arm. \"just let me ...\" \"never!\" cried the savage. \"but look here, old man ...\" \"throw it all away, that horrible poison.\" the words \"throw it all away\" pierced through the enfolding layers of incomprehension to the quick of the delta's consciousness. an angry murmur went up from the crowd. \"i come to bring you freedom,\" said the savage, turning back towards the twins. \"i come ...\" the deputy sub-bursar heard no more; he had slipped out of the ves- tibule and was looking up a number in the telephone book. \"not in his own rooms,\" bernard summed up. \"not in mine, not in yours. not at the aphroditaum; not at the centre or the college. where can he have got to?\" helmholtz shrugged his shoulders. they had come back from their work expecting to find the savage waiting for them at one or other of the usual meeting-places, and there was no sign of the fellow. which was annoying, as they had meant to nip across to biarritz in helm- holtz's four-seater sporticopter. they'd be late for dinner if he didn't come soon. \"we'll give him five more minutes,\" said helmholtz. \"if he doesn't turn up by then, we'll ...\" the ringing of the telephone bell interrupted him. he picked up the re- ceiver. \"hullo. speaking.\" then, after a long interval of listening, \"ford in flivver!\" he swore. \"i'll come at once.\" \"what is it?\" bernard asked. \"a fellow i know at the park lane hospital,\" said helmholtz. \"the sav- age is there. seems to have gone mad. anyhow, it's urgent. will you come with me?\" together they hurried along the corridor to the lifts. \"but do you like being slaves?\" the savage was saying as they entered the hospital. his face was flushed, his eyes bright with ardour and in- dignation. \"do you like being babies? yes, babies. mewling and puk- ing,\" he added, exasperated by their bestial stupidity into throwing in- suits at those he had come to save. the insults bounced off their cara- pace of thick stupidity; they stared at him with a blank expression of dull and sullen resentment in their eyes. \"yes, puking!\" he fairly shouted. grief and remorse, compassion and duty-all were forgotten now and, as it were, absorbed into an intense overpowering hatred of these less than human monsters. \"don't you want to be free and men? don't you even understand what manhood and freedom are?\" rage was making him fluent; the words came easily, in a rush. \"don't you?\" he repeated, but got no answer to his question. \"very well then,\" he went on grimly. \"i'll teach you; i'll make you be free whether you want to or not.\" and pushing open a window that looked on to the inner court of the hospital, he began to throw the little pill-boxes of soma tablets in handfuls out into the area. for a moment the khaki mob was silent, petrified, at the spectacle of this wanton sacrilege, with amazement and horror. \"he's mad,\" whispered bernard, staring with wide open eyes. \"they'll kill him. they'll ...\" a great shout suddenly went up from the mob; a wave of movement drove it menacingly towards the savage. \"ford help him!\" said bernard, and averted his eyes. \"ford helps those who help themselves.\" and with a laugh, actually a laugh of exultation, helmholtz watson pushed his way through the crowd. \"free, free!\" the savage shouted, and with one hand continued to throw the soma into the area while, with the other, he punched the in- distinguishable faces of his assailants. \"free!\" and suddenly there was helmholtz at his side-\"good old helmholtz!\"-also punching-\"men at last!\"-and in the interval also throwing the poison out by handfuls through the open window. \"yes, men! men!\" and there was no more poison left. he picked up the cash-box and showed them its black emptiness. \"you're free!\" howling, the deltas charged with a redoubled fury. hesitant on the fringes of the battle. \"they're done for,\" said bernard and, urged by a sudden impulse, ran forward to help them; then thought better of it and halted; then, ashamed, stepped forward again; then again thought better of it, and was standing in an agony of humiliated indecision-thinking that they might be killed if he didn't help them, and that he might be killed if he did-when (ford be praised!), goggle-eyed and swine-snouted in their gas-masks, in ran the police. bernard dashed to meet them. he waved his arms; and it was action, he was doing something. he shouted \"help!\" several times, more and more loudly so as to give himself the illusion of helping. \"help! help! help!\" the policemen pushed him out of the way and got on with their work. three men with spraying machines buckled to their shoulders pumped thick clouds of soma vapour into the air. two more were busy round the portable synthetic music box. carrying water pistols charged with a powerful anaesthetic, four others had pushed their way into the crowd and were methodically laying out, squirt by squirt, the more fe- rocious of the fighters. \"quick, quick!\" yelled bernard. \"they'll be killed if you don't hurry. they'll ... oh!\" annoyed by his chatter, one of the policemen had given him a shot from his water pistol. bernard stood for a second or two wambling unsteadily on legs that seemed to have lost their bones, their tendons, their muscles, to have become mere sticks of jelly, and at last not even jelly-water: he tumbled in a heap on the floor. suddenly, from out of the synthetic music box a voice began to speak. the voice of reason, the voice of good feeling. the sound-track roll was unwinding itself in synthetic anti-riot speech number two (me- dium strength). straight from the depths of a non-existent heart, \"my friends, my friends!\" said the voice so pathetically, with a note of such infinitely tender reproach that, behind their gas masks, even the po- licemen's eyes were momentarily dimmed with tears, \"what is the meaning of this? why aren't you all being happy and good together? happy and good,\" the voice repeated. \"at peace, at peace.\" it trem- bled, sank into a whisper and momentarily expired. \"oh, i do want you to be happy,\" it began, with a yearning earnestness. \"i do so want you to be good! please, please be good and ...\" two minutes later the voice and the soma vapour had produced their effect. in tears, the deltas were kissing and hugging one another-half a dozen twins at a time in a comprehensive embrace. even helmholtz and the savage were almost crying. a fresh supply of pill-boxes was brought in from the bursary; a new distribution was hastily made and, to the sound of the voice's richly affectionate, baritone valedictions, the twins dispersed, blubbering as though their hearts would break. \"good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, ford keep you! good-bye, my dearest, dearest friends, ford keep you. good-bye my dearest, dearest when the last of the deltas had gone the policeman switched off the current. the angelic voice fell silent. \"will you come quietly?\" asked the sergeant, \"or must we anaesthe- tize?\" he pointed his water pistol menacingly. \"oh, we'll come quietly,\" the savage answered, dabbing alternately a cut lip, a scratched neck, and a bitten left hand. still keeping his handkerchief to his bleeding nose helmholtz nodded in confirmation. awake and having recovered the use of his legs, bernard had chosen this moment to move as inconspicuously as he could towards the door. \"hi, you there,\" called the sergeant, and a swine-masked policeman hurried across the room and laid a hand on the young man's shoulder. bernard turned with an expression of indignant innocence. escaping? he hadn't dreamed of such a thing. \"though what on earth you want me for,\" he said to the sergeant, \"i really can't imagine.\" \"you're a friend of the prisoner's, aren't you?\" \"well ...\" said bernard, and hesitated. no, he really couldn't deny it. \"why shouldn't i be?\" he asked. \"come on then,\" said the sergeant, and led the way towards the door and the waiting police car. chapter sixteen the room into which the three were ushered was the controller's study. \"his fordship will be down in a moment.\" the gamma butler left them to themselves. helmholtz laughed aloud. \"it's more like a caffeine-solution party than a trial,\" he said, and let himself fall into the most luxurious of the pneumatic arm-chairs. \"cheer up, bernard,\" he added, catching sight of his friend's green un- happy face. but bernard would not be cheered; without answering, without even looking at helmholtz, he went and sat down on the most uncomfortable chair in the room, carefully chosen in the obscure hope of somehow deprecating the wrath of the higher powers. the savage meanwhile wandered restlessly round the room, peering with a vague superficial inquisitiveness at the books in the shelves, at the sound-track rolls and reading machine bobbins in their numbered pigeon-holes. on the table under the window lay a massive volume bound in limp black leather-surrogate, and stamped with large golden t's. he picked it up and opened it. my life and work, by our ford. the book had been published at detroit by the society for the propa- gation of fordian knowledge. idly he turned the pages, read a sen- tence here, a paragraph there, and had just come to the conclusion that the book didn't interest him, when the door opened, and the resi- dent world controller for western europe walked briskly into the room. mustapha mond shook hands with all three of them; but it was to the savage that he addressed himself. \"so you don't much like civilization, mr. savage,\" he said. the savage looked at him. he had been prepared to lie, to bluster, to remain sullenly unresponsive; but, reassured by the good-humoured intelligence of the controller's face, he decided to tell the truth, straightforwardly. \"no.\" he shook his head. bernard started and looked horrified. what would the controller think? to be labelled as the friend of a man who said that he didn't like civili- zation-said it openly and, of all people, to the controller-it was terri- ble. \"but, john,\" he began. a look from mustapha mond reduced him to an abject silence. \"of course,\" the savage went on to admit, \"there are some very nice things. all that music in the air, for instance ...\" \"sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about my ears and sometimes voices.\" the savage's face lit up with a sudden pleasure. \"have you read it too?\" he asked. \"i thought nobody knew about that book here, in eng- land.\" \"almost nobody. i'm one of the very few. it's prohibited, you see. but as i make the laws here, i can also break them. with impunity, mr. marx,\" he added, turning to bernard. \"which i'm afraid you can't do.\" bernard sank into a yet more hopeless misery. \"but why is it prohibited?\" asked the savage. in the excitement of meeting a man who had read shakespeare he had momentarily forgot- ten everything else. the controller shrugged his shoulders. \"because it's old; that's the chief reason. we haven't any use for old things here.\" \"even when they're beautiful?\" \"particularly when they're beautiful. beauty's attractive, and we don't want people to be attracted by old things. we want them to like the new ones.\" \"but the new ones are so stupid and horrible. those plays, where there's nothing but helicopters flying about and you feel the people kissing.\" he made a grimace. \"goats and monkeys!\" only in othello's word could he find an adequate vehicle for his contempt and hatred. \"nice tame animals, anyhow,\" the controller murmured parentheti- cally. \"why don't you let them see othello instead?\" \"i've told you; it's old. besides, they couldn't understand it.\" yes, that was true. he remembered how helmholtz had laughed at romeo and juliet. \"well then,\" he said, after a pause, \"something new that's like othello, and that they could understand.\" \"that's what we've all been wanting to write,\" said helmholtz, breaking a long silence. \"and it's what you never will write,\" said the controller. \"because, if it were really like othello nobody could understand it, however new it might be. and if were new, it couldn't possibly be like othello.\" \"why not?\" \"yes, why not?\" helmholtz repeated. he too was forgetting the un- pleasant realities of the situation. green with anxiety and apprehen- sion, only bernard remembered them; the others ignored him. \"why not?\" \"because our world is not the same as othello's world. you can't make flivvers without steel-and you can't make tragedies without social in- stability. the world's stable now. people are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can't get. they're well off; they're safe; they're never ill; they're not afraid of death; they're bliss- fully ignorant of passion and old age; they're plagued with no mothers or fathers; they've got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they're so conditioned that they practically can't help behaving as they ought to behave. and if anything should go wrong, there's soma. which you go and chuck out of the window in the name of lib- erty, mr. savage. liberty!\" he laughed. \"expecting deltas to know what liberty is! and now expecting them to understand othello! my good boy!\" the savage was silent for a little. \"all the same,\" he insisted obsti- nately, \"othello's good, othello's better than those feelies.\" \"of course it is,\" the controller agreed. \"but that's the price we have to pay for stability. you've got to choose between happiness and what people used to call high art. we've sacrificed the high art. we have the feelies and the scent organ instead.\" \"but they don't mean anything.\" \"they mean themselves; they mean a lot of agreeable sensations to the audience.\" \"but they're ... they're told by an idiot.\" the controller laughed. \"you're not being very polite to your friend, mr. watson. one of our most distinguished emotional engineers ...\" \"but he's right,\" said helmholtz gloomily. \"because it is idiotic. writing when there's nothing to say ...\" \"precisely. but that requires the most enormous ingenuity. you're mak- ing flivvers out of the absolute minimum of steel-works of art out of practically nothing but pure sensation.\" the savage shook his head. \"it all seems to me quite horrible.\" \"of course it does. actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. and, of course, stability isn't nearly so spectacular as instability. and being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. happiness is never grand.\" \"i suppose not,\" said the savage after a silence. \"but need it be quite so bad as those twins?\" he passed his hand over his eyes as though he were trying to wipe away the remembered image of those long rows of identical midgets at the assembling tables, those queued-up twin- herds at the entrance to the brentford monorail station, those human maggots swarming round linda's bed of death, the endlessly repeated face of his assailants. he looked at his bandaged left hand and shud- dered. \"horrible!\" \"but how useful! i see you don't like our bokanovsky groups; but, i assure you, they're the foundation on which everything else is built. they're the gyroscope that stabilizes the rocket plane of state on its unswerving course.\" the deep voice thrillingly vibrated; the gesticulat- ing hand implied all space and the onrush of the irresistible machine. mustapha mond's oratory was almost up to synthetic standards. \"i was wondering,\" said the savage, \"why you had them at all-seeing that you can get whatever you want out of those bottles. why don't you make everybody an alpha double plus while you're about it?\" mustapha mond laughed. \"because we have no wish to have our throats cut,\" he answered. \"we believe in happiness and stability. a society of alphas couldn't fail to be unstable and miserable. imagine a factory staffed by alphas-that is to say by separate and unrelated in- dividuals of good heredity and conditioned so as to be capable (within limits) of making a free choice and assuming responsibilities. imagine it!\" he repeated. the savage tried to imagine it, not very successfully. \"it's an absurdity. an alpha-decanted, alpha-conditioned man would go mad if he had to do epsilon semi-moron work-go mad, or start smashing things up. alphas can be completely socialized-but only on condition that you make them do alpha work. only an epsilon can be expected to make epsilon sacrifices, for the good reason that for him they aren't sacrifices; they're the line of least resistance. his condition- ing has laid down rails along which he's got to run. he can't help him- self; he's foredoomed. even after decanting, he's still inside a bot- tle-an invisible bottle of infantile and embryonic fixations. each one of us, of course,\" the controller meditatively continued, \"goes through life inside a bottle. but if we happen to be alphas, our bottles are, rela- tively speaking, enormous. we should suffer acutely if we were con- fined in a narrower space. you cannot pour upper-caste champagne- surrogate into lower-caste bottles. it's obvious theoretically. but it has also been proved in actual practice. the result of the cyprus experi- ment was convincing.\" \"what was that?\" asked the savage. mustapha mond smiled. \"well, you can call it an experiment in rebot- tling if you like. it began in a.f. 473. the controllers had the island of cyprus cleared of all its existing inhabitants and re-colonized with a specially prepared batch of twenty-two thousand alphas. all agricul- tural and industrial equipment was handed over to them and they were left to manage their own affairs. the result exactly fulfilled all the theoretical predictions. the land wasn't properly worked; there were strikes in all the factories; the laws were set at naught, orders dis- obeyed; all the people detailed for a spell of low-grade work were per- petually intriguing for high-grade jobs, and all the people with high- grade jobs were counter-intriguing at all costs to stay where they were. within six years they were having a first-class civil war. when nineteen out of the twenty-two thousand had been killed, the survivors unanimously petitioned the world controllers to resume the govern- ment of the island. which they did. and that was the end of the only society of alphas that the world has ever seen.\" the savage sighed, profoundly. \"the optimum population,\" said mustapha mond, \"is modelled on the iceberg-eight-ninths below the water line, one-ninth above.\" \"and they're happy below the water line?\" \"happier than above it. happier than your friend here, for example.\" he pointed. \"in spite of that awful work?\" \"awful? they don't find it so. on the contrary, they like it. it's light, it's childishly simple. no strain on the mind or the muscles. seven and a half hours of mild, unexhausting labour, and then the soma ration and games and unrestricted copulation and the feelies. what more can they ask for? true,\" he added, \"they might ask for shorter hours. and of course we could give them shorter hours. technically, it would be perfectly simple to reduce all lower-caste working hours to three or four a day. but would they be any the happier for that? no, they wouldn't. the experiment was tried, more than a century and a half ago. the whole of ireland was put on to the four-hour day. what was the result? unrest and a large increase in the consumption of soma; that was all. those three and a half hours of extra leisure were so far from being a source of happiness, that people felt constrained to take a holiday from them. the inventions office is stuffed with plans for labour-saving processes. thousands of them.\" mustapha mond made a lavish gesture. \"and why don't we put them into execution? for the sake of the labourers; it would be sheer cruelty to afflict them with ex- cessive leisure. it's the same with agriculture. we could synthesize every morsel of food, if we wanted to. but we don't. we prefer to keep a third of the population on the land. for their own sakes-because it takes longer to get food out of the land than out of a factory. besides, we have our stability to think of. we don't want to change. every change is a menace to stability. that's another reason why we're so chary of applying new inventions. every discovery in pure science is potentially subversive; even science must sometimes be treated as a possible enemy. yes, even science.\" science? the savage frowned. he knew the word. but what it exactly signified he could not say. shakespeare and the old men of the pueblo had never mentioned science, and from linda he had only gathered the vaguest hints: science was something you made helicopters with, some thing that caused you to laugh at the corn dances, something that prevented you from being wrinkled and losing your teeth. he made a desperate effort to take the controller's meaning. \"yes,\" mustapha mond was saying, \"that's another item in the cost of stability. it isn't only art that's incompatible with happiness; it's also science. science is dangerous; we have to keep it most carefully chained and muzzled.\" \"what?\" said helmholtz, in astonishment. \"but we're always saying that science is everything. it's a hypnopaedic platitude.\" \"three times a week between thirteen and seventeen,\" put in bernard. \"and all the science propaganda we do at the college ...\" \"yes; but what sort of science?\" asked mustapha mond sarcastically. \"you've had no scientific training, so you can't judge. i was a pretty good physicist in my time. too good-good enough to realize that all our science is just a cookery book, with an orthodox theory of cooking that nobody's allowed to question, and a list of recipes that mustn't be added to except by special permission from the head cook. i'm the head cook now. but i was an inquisitive young scullion once. i started doing a bit of cooking on my own. unorthodox cooking, illicit cooking. a bit of real science, in fact.\" he was silent. \"what happened?\" asked helmholtz watson. the controller sighed. \"very nearly what's going to happen to you young men. i was on the point of being sent to an island.\" the words galvanized bernard into violent and unseemly activity. \"send me to an island?\" he jumped up, ran across the room, and stood gesticulating in front of the controller. \"you can't send me. i haven't done anything. it was the others. i swear it was the others.\" he pointed accusingly to helmholtz and the savage. \"oh, please don't send me to iceland. i promise i'll do what i ought to do. give me an- other chance. please give me another chance.\" the tears began to flow. \"i tell you, it's their fault,\" he sobbed. \"and not to iceland. oh please, your fordship, please ...\" and in a paroxysm of abjection he threw himself on his knees before the controller. mustapha mond tried to make him get up; but bernard persisted in his grovelling; the stream of words poured out inexhaustibly. in the end the controller had to ring for his fourth secretary. \"bring three men,\" he ordered, \"and take mr. marx into a bedroom. give him a good soma vaporization and then put him to bed and leave him.\" the fourth secretary went out and returned with three green- uniformed twin footmen. still shouting and sobbing. bernard was car- ried out. \"one would think he was going to have his throat cut,\" said the con- troller, as the door closed. \"whereas, if he had the smallest sense, he'd understand that his punishment is really a reward. he's being sent to an island. that's to say, he's being sent to a place where he'll meet the most interesting set of men and women to be found anywhere in the world. all the people who, for one reason or another, have got too self- consciously individual to fit into community-life. all the people who aren't satisfied with orthodoxy, who've got independent ideas of their own. every one, in a word, who's any one. i almost envy you, mr. wat- son.\" helmholtz laughed. \"then why aren't you on an island yourself?\" \"because, finally, i preferred this,\" the controller answered. \"i was given the choice: to be sent to an island, where i could have got on with my pure science, or to be taken on to the controllers' council with the prospect of succeeding in due course to an actual controllership. i chose this and let the science go.\" after a little silence, \"sometimes,\" he added, \"i rather regret the science. happiness is a hard mas- ter-particularly other people's happiness. a much harder master, if one isn't conditioned to accept it unquestioningly, than truth.\" he sighed, fell silent again, then continued in a brisker tone, \"well, duty's duty. one can't consult one's own preference. i'm interested in truth, i like science. but truth's a menace, science is a public danger. as dangerous as it's been beneficent. it has given us the stablest equilibrium in his- tory. china's was hopelessly insecure by comparison; even the primi- tive matriarchies weren't steadier than we are. thanks, i repeat, to science. but we can't allow science to undo its own good work. that's why we so carefully limit the scope of its researches-that's why i al- most got sent to an island. we don't allow it to deal with any but the most immediate problems of the moment. all other enquiries are most sedulously discouraged. it's curious,\" he went on after a little pause, \"to read what people in the time of our ford used to write about scien- tific progress. they seemed to have imagined that it could be allowed to go on indefinitely, regardless of everything else. knowledge was the highest good, truth the supreme value; all the rest was secondary and subordinate. true, ideas were beginning to change even then. our ford himself did a great deal to shift the emphasis from truth and beauty to comfort and happiness. mass production demanded the shift. universal happiness keeps the wheels steadily turning; truth and beauty can't. and, of course, whenever the masses seized political power, then it was happiness rather than truth and beauty that mattered. still, in spite of everytung, unrestricted scientific research was still permitted. people still went on talking about truth and beauty as though they were the sovereign goods. right up to the time of the nine years' war. that made them change their tune all right. what's the point of truth or beauty or knowledge when the anthrax bombs are popping all around you? that was when science first began to be controlled-after the nine years' war. people were ready to have even their appetites controlled then. anything for a quiet life. we've gone on controlling ever since. it hasn't been very good for truth, of course. but it's been very good for happiness. one can't have something for nothing. hap- piness has got to be paid for. you're paying for it, mr. watson-paying because you happen to be too much interested in beauty. i was too much interested in truth; i paid too.\" \"but you didn't go to an island,\" said the savage, breaking a long si- lence. the controller smiled. \"that's how i paid. by choosing to serve happi- ness. other people's-not mine. it's lucky,\" he added, after a pause, \"that there are such a lot of islands in the world. i don't know what we should do without them. put you all in the lethal chamber, i suppose. by the way, mr. watson, would you like a tropical climate? the mar- quesas, for example; or samoa? or something rather more bracing?\" helmholtz rose from his pneumatic chair. \"i should like a thoroughly bad climate,\" he answered. \"i believe one would write better if the cli- mate were bad. if there were a lot of wind and storms, for example ...\" the controller nodded his approbation. \"i like your spirit, mr. watson. i like it very much indeed. as much as i officially disapprove of it.\" he smiled. \"what about the falkland islands?\" \"yes, i think that will do,\" helmholtz answered. \"and now, if you don't mind, i'll go and see how poor bernard's getting on.\" chapter seventeen art, science-you seem to have paid a fairly high price for your hap- piness,\" said the savage, when they were alone. \"anything else?\" \"well, religion, of course,\" replied the controller. \"there used to be something called god-before the nine years' war. but i was forgetting; you know all about god, i suppose.\" \"well ...\" the savage hesitated. he would have liked to say something about solitude, about night, about the mesa lying pale under the moon, about the precipice, the plunge into shadowy darkness, about death. he would have liked to speak; but there were no words. not even in shakespeare. the controller, meanwhile, had crossed to the other side of the room and was unlocking a large safe set into the wall between the book- shelves. the heavy door swung open. rummaging in the darkness within, \"it's a subject,\" he said, \"that has always had a great interest for me.\" he pulled out a thick black volume. \"you've never read this, for example.\" the savage took it. \"the holy bible, containing the old and new tes- taments/' he read aloud from the title-page. \"nor this.\" it was a small book and had lost its cover. \"the imitation of christ \" \"nor this.\" he handed out another volume. \"the varieties of religious experience. by william james.\" \"and i've got plenty more,\" mustapha mond continued, resuming his seat. \"a whole collection of pornographic old books. god in the safe and ford on the shelves.\" he pointed with a laugh to his avowed li- brary-to the shelves of books, the rack full of reading-machine bob- bins and sound-track rolls. \"but if you know about god, why don't you tell them?\" asked the sav- age indignantly. \"why don't you give them these books about god?\" \"for the same reason as we don't give them othello: they're old; they're about god hundreds of years ago. not about god now.\" \"but god doesn't change.\" \"men do, though.\" \"what difference does that make?\" \"all the difference in the world,\" said mustapha mond. he got up again and walked to the safe. \"there was a man called cardinal newman,\" he said. \"a cardinal,\" he exclaimed parenthetically, \"was a kind of arch-community-songster.\" '\"i pandulph, of fair milan, cardinal.' i've read about them in shake- speare.\" \"of course you have. well, as i was saying, there was a man called cardinal newman. ah, here's the book.\" he pulled it out. \"and while i'm about it i'll take this one too. it's by a man called maine de biran. he was a philosopher, if you know what that was.\" \"a man who dreams of fewer things than there are in heaven and earth,\" said the savage promptly. \"quite so. i'll read you one of the things he did dream of in a moment. meanwhile, listen to what this old arch-community-songster said.\" he opened the book at the place marked by a slip of paper and began to read. '\"we are not our own any more than what we possess is our own. we did not make ourselves, we cannot be supreme over our- selves. we are not our own masters. we are god's property. is it not our happiness thus to view the matter? is it any happiness or any comfort, to consider that we are our own? it may be thought so by the young and prosperous. these may think it a great thing to have every- thing, as they suppose, their own way-to depend on no one-to have to think of nothing out of sight, to be without the irksomeness of con- tinual acknowledgment, continual prayer, continual reference of what they do to the will of another. but as time goes on, they, as all men, will find that independence was not made for man-that it is an unnatu- ral state-will do for a while, but will not carry us on safely to the end ...'\" mustapha mond paused, put down the first book and, picking up the other, turned over the pages. \"take this, for example,\" he said, and in his deep voice once more began to read: \"'a man grows old; he feels in himself that radical sense of weakness, of listlessness, of dis- comfort, which accompanies the advance of age; and, feeling thus, imagines himself merely sick, lulling his fears with the notion that this distressing condition is due to some particular cause, from which, as from an illness, he hopes to recover. vain imaginings! that sickness is old age; and a horrible disease it is. they say that it is the fear of death and of what comes after death that makes men turn to religion as they advance in years. but my own experience has given me the conviction that, quite apart from any such terrors or imaginings, the religious sentiment tends to develop as we grow older; to develop be- cause, as the passions grow calm, as the fancy and sensibilities are less excited and less excitable, our reason becomes less troubled in its working, less obscured by the images, desires and distractions, in which it used to be absorbed; whereupon god emerges as from behind a cloud; our soul feels, sees, turns towards the source of all light; turns naturally and inevitably; for now that all that gave to the world of sensations its life and charms has begun to leak away from us, now that phenomenal existence is no more bolstered up by impressions from within or from without, we feel the need to lean on something that abides, something that will never play us false-a reality, an abso- lute and everlasting truth. yes, we inevitably turn to god; for this re- ligious sentiment is of its nature so pure, so delightful to the soul that experiences it, that it makes up to us for all our other losses.'\" musta- pha mond shut the book and leaned back in his chair. \"one of the nu- merous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn't dream about was this\" (he waved his hand), \"us, the modern world. 'you can only be independent of god while you've got youth and pros- perity; independence won't take you safely to the end.' well, we've now got youth and prosperity right up to the end. what follows? evi- dently, that we can be independent of god. 'the religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.' but there aren't any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous. and why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires, when youthful desires never fail? a substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last? what need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity? of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is the social or- der?\" \"then you think there is no god?\" \"no, i think there quite probably is one.\" \"then why? ...\" mustapha mond checked him. \"but he manifests himself in different ways to different men. in premodern times he manifested himself as the being that's described in these books. now ...\" \"how does he manifest himself now?\" asked the savage. \"well, he manifests himself as an absence; as though he weren't there at all.\" \"that's your fault.\" \"call it the fault of civilization. god isn't compatible with machinery and scientific medicine and universal happiness. you must make your choice. our civilization has chosen machinery and medicine and happi- ness. that's why i have to keep these books locked up in the safe. they're smut. people would be shocked it ...\" the savage interrupted him. \"but isn't it natural to feel there's a god?\" \"you might as well ask if it's natural to do up one's trousers with zip- pers,\" said the controller sarcastically. \"you remind me of another of those old fellows called bradley. he defined philosophy as the finding of bad reason for what one believes by instinct. as if one believed any- thing by instinct! one believes things because one has been condi- tioned to believe them. finding bad reasons for what one believes for other bad reasons-that's philosophy. people believe in god because they've been conditioned to. \"but all the same,\" insisted the savage, \"it is natural to believe in god when you're alone-quite alone, in the night, thinking about death ...\" \"but people never are alone now,\" said mustapha mond. \"we make them hate solitude; and we arrange their lives so that it's almost im- possible for them ever to have it.\" the savage nodded gloomily. at malpais he had suffered because they had shut him out from the communal activities of the pueblo, in civi- lized london he was suffering because he could never escape from those communal activities, never be quietly alone. \"do you remember that bit in king lear?\" said the savage at last. '\"the gods are just and of our pleasant vices make instruments to plague us; the dark and vicious place where thee he got cost him his eyes,' and edmund answers-you remember, he's wounded, he's dy- ing-'thou hast spoken right; 'tis true. the wheel has come full circle; i am here.' what about that now? doesn't there seem to be a god man- aging things, punishing, rewarding?\" \"well, does there?\" questioned the controller in his turn. \"you can in- dulge in any number of pleasant vices with a freemartin and run no risks of having your eyes put out by your son's mistress. 'the wheel has come full circle; i am here.' but where would edmund be nowa- days? sitting in a pneumatic chair, with his arm round a girl's waist, sucking away at his sex-hormone chewing-gum and looking at the feelies. the gods are just. no doubt. but their code of law is dictated, in the last resort, by the people who organize society; providence takes its cue from men.\" \"are you sure?\" asked the savage. \"are you quite sure that the ed- mund in that pneumatic chair hasn't been just as heavily punished as the edmund who's wounded and bleeding to death? the gods are just. haven't they used his pleasant vices as an instrument to degrade him?\" \"degrade him from what position? as a happy, hard-working, goods- consuming citizen he's perfect. of course, if you choose some other standard than ours, then perhaps you might say he was degraded. but you've got to stick to one set of postulates. you can't play electro- magnetic golf according to the rules of centrifugal bumble-puppy.\" \"but value dwells not in particular will,\" said the savage. \"it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein 'tis precious of itself as in the prizer.\" \"come, come,\" protested mustapha mond, \"that's going rather far, isn't it?\" \"if you allowed yourselves to think of god, you wouldn't allow your- selves to be degraded by pleasant vices. you'd have a reason for bear- ing things patiently, for doing things with courage. i've seen it with the indians.\" \"i'm sure you have,\" said mustapha mond. \"but then we aren't indians. there isn't any need for a civilized man to bear anything that's seri- ously unpleasant. and as for doing things-ford forbid that he should get the idea into his head. it would upset the whole social order if men started doing things on their own.\" \"what about self-denial, then? if you had a god, you'd have a reason for self-denial.\" \"but industrial civilization is only possible when there's no self-denial. self-indulgence up to the very limits imposed by hygiene and econom- ics. otherwise the wheels stop turning.\" \"you'd have a reason for chastity!\" said the savage, blushing a little as he spoke the words. \"but chastity means passion, chastity means neurasthenia. and pas- sion and neurasthenia mean instability. and instability means the end of civilization. you can't have a lasting civilization without plenty of pleasant vices.\" \"but god's the reason for everything noble and fine and heroic. if you had a god ...\" \"my dear young friend,\" said mustapha mond, \"civilization has abso- lutely no need of nobility or heroism. these things are symptoms of political inefficiency. in a properly organized society like ours, nobody has any opportunities for being noble or heroic. conditions have got to be thoroughly unstable before the occasion can arise. where there are wars, where there are divided allegiances, where there are tempta- tions to be resisted, objects of love to be fought for or defended-there, obviously, nobility and heroism have some sense. but there aren't any wars nowadays. the greatest care is taken to prevent you from loving any one too much. there's no such thing as a divided allegiance; you're so conditioned that you can't help doing what you ought to do. and what you ought to do is on the whole so pleasant, so many of the natural impulses are allowed free play, that there really aren't any temptations to resist. and if ever, by some unlucky chance, anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always soma to give you a holiday from the facts. and there's always soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your enemies, to make you patient and long- suffering. in the past you could only accomplish these things by mak- ing a great effort and after years of hard moral training. now, you swallow two or three half-gramme tablets, and there you are. anybody can be virtuous now. you can carry at least half your mortality about in a bottle. christianity without tears-that's what soma is.\" \"but the tears are necessary. don't you remember what othello said? 'if after every tempest came such calms, may the winds blow till they have wakened death.' there's a story one of the old indians used to tell us, about the girl of mataski. the young men who wanted to marry her had to do a morning's hoeing in her garden. it seemed easy; but there were flies and mosquitoes, magic ones. most of the young men simply couldn't stand the biting and stinging. but the one that could- he got the girl.\" \"charming! but in civilized countries,\" said the controller, \"you can have girls without hoeing for them, and there aren't any flies or mos- quitoes to sting you. we got rid of them all centuries ago.\" the savage nodded, frowning. \"you got rid of them. yes, that's just like you. getting rid of everything unpleasant instead of learning to put up with it. whether 'tis better in the mind to suffer the slings and ar- rows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles and by opposing end them ... but you don't do either. neither suffer nor oppose. you just abolish the slings and arrows. it's too easy.\" he was suddenly silent, thinking of his mother. in her room on the thirty-seventh floor, linda had floated in a sea of singing lights and perfumed caresses-floated away, out of space, out of time, out of the prison of her memories, her habits, her aged and bloated body. and tomakin, ex-director of hatcheries and conditioning, tomakin was still on holiday-on holiday from humiliation and pain, in a world where he could not hear those words, that derisive laughter, could not see that hideous face, feel those moist and flabby arms round his neck, in a beautiful world ... \"what you need,\" the savage went on, \"is something with tears for a change. nothing costs enough here.\" (\"twelve and a half million dollars,\" henry foster had protested when the savage told him that. \"twelve and a half million-that's what the new conditioning centre cost. not a cent less.\") \"exposing what is mortal and unsure to all that fortune, death and danger dare, even for an eggshell. isn't there something in that?\" he asked, looking up at mustapha mond. \"quite apart from god-though of course god would be a reason for it. isn't there something in living dangerously?\" \"there's a great deal in it,\" the controller replied. \"men and women must have their adrenals stimulated from time to time.\" \"what?\" questioned the savage, uncomprehending. \"it's one of the conditions of perfect health. that's why we've made the v.p.s. treatments compulsory.\" \"v.p.s.?\" \"violent passion surrogate. regularly once a month. we flood the whole system with adrenin. it's the complete physiological equivalent of fear and rage. all the tonic effects of murdering desdemona and be- ing murdered by othello, without any of the inconveniences.\" \"but i like the inconveniences.\" \"we don't,\" said the controller. \"we prefer to do things comfortably.\" \"but i don't want comfort. i want god, i want poetry, i want real dan- ger, i want freedom, i want goodness. i want sin.\" \"in fact,\" said mustapha mond, \"you're claiming the right to be un- happy.\" \"all right then,\" said the savage defiantly, \"i'm claiming the right to be unhappy.\" \"not to mention the right to grow old and ugly and impotent; the right to have syphilis and cancer; the right to have too little to eat; the right to be lousy; the right to live in constant apprehension of what may happen to-morrow; the right to catch typhoid; the right to be tortured by unspeakable pains of every kind.\" there was a long silence. \"i claim them all,\" said the savage at last. mustapha mond shrugged his shoulders. \"you're welcome,\" he said. chapter eighteen the door was ajar; they entered. \"john!\" from the bathroom came an unpleasant and characteristic sound. \"is there anything the matter?\" helmholtz called. there was no answer. the unpleasant sound was repeated, twice; there was silence. then, with a click the bathroom door opened and, very pale, the savage emerged. \"i say,\" helmholtz exclaimed solicitously, \"you do look ill, john!\" \"did you eat something that didn't agree with you?\" asked bernard. the savage nodded. \"i ate civilization.\" \"what?\" \"it poisoned me; i was defiled. and then,\" he added, in a lower tone, \"i ate my own wickedness.\" \"yes, but what exactly? ... i mean, just now you were ...\" \"now i am purified,\" said the savage. \"i drank some mustard and warm water.\" the others stared at him in astonishment. \"do you mean to say that you were doing it on purpose?\" asked bernard. \"that's how the indians always purify themselves.\" he sat down and, sighing, passed his hand across his forehead. \"i shall rest for a few minutes,\" he said. \"i'm rather tired.\" \"well, i'm not surprised,\" said helmholtz. after a silence, \"we've come to say good-bye,\" he went on in another tone. \"we're off to-morrow morning.\" \"yes, we're off to-morrow,\" said bernard on whose face the savage remarked a new expression of determined resignation. \"and by the way, john,\" he continued, leaning forward in his chair and laying a hand on the savage's knee, \"i want to say how sorry i am about eve- rything that happened yesterday.\" he blushed. \"how ashamed,\" he went on, in spite of the unsteadiness of his voice, \"how really ...\" the savage cut him short and, taking his hand, affectionately pressed it. \"helmholtz was wonderful to me,\" bernard resumed, after a little pause. \"if it hadn't been for him, i should ...\" \"now, now,\" helmholtz protested. there was a silence. in spite of their sadness-because of it, even; for their sadness was the symptom of their love for one another-the three young men were happy. \"i went to see the controller this morning,\" said the savage at last. \"what for?\" \"to ask if i mightn't go to the islands with you.\" \"and what did he say?\" asked helmholtz eagerly. the savage shook his head. \"he wouldn't let me.\" \"why not?\" \"he said he wanted to go on with the experiment. but i'm damned,\" the savage added, with sudden fury, \"i'm damned if i'll go on being experimented with. not for all the controllers in the world. i shall go away to-morrow too.\" \"but where?\" the others asked in unison. the savage shrugged his shoulders. \"anywhere. i don't care. so long as i can be alone.\" from guildford the down-line followed the wey valley to godalming, then, over milford and witley, proceeded to haslemere and on through petersfield towards portsmouth. roughly parallel to it, the upline passed over worplesden, tongham, puttenham, elstead and grayshott. between the hog's back and hindhead there were points where the two lines were not more than six or seven kilometres apart. the dis- tance was too small for careless flyers-particularly at night and when they had taken half a gramme too much. there had been accidents. serious ones. it had been decided to deflect the upline a few kilome- tres to the west. between grayshott and tongham four abandoned air- lighthouses marked the course of the old portsmouth-to-london road. the skies above them were silent and deserted. it was over selborne, bordon and farnham that the helicopters now ceaselessly hummed and roared. the savage had chosen as his hermitage the old light-house which stood on the crest of the hill between puttenham and elstead. the building was of ferro-concrete and in excellent condition-almost too comfortable the savage had thought when he first explored the place, almost too civilizedly luxurious. he pacified his conscience by promis- ing himself a compensatingly harder self-discipline, purifications the more complete and thorough. his first night in the hermitage was, de- liberately, a sleepless one. he spent the hours on his knees praying, now to that heaven from which the guilty claudius had begged for- giveness, now in zuni to awonawilona, now to jesus and pookong, now to his own guardian animal, the eagle. from time to time he stretched out his arms as though he were on the cross, and held them thus through long minutes of an ache that gradually increased till it became a tremulous and excruciating agony; held them, in voluntary crucifix- ion, while he repeated, through clenched teeth (the sweat, meanwhile, pouring down his face), \"oh, forgive me! oh, make me pure! oh, help me to be good!\" again and again, till he was on the point of fainting from the pain. when morning came, he felt he had earned the right to inhabit the lighthouse; yet, even though there still was glass in most of the win- dows, even though the view from the platform was so fine. for the very reason why he had chosen the lighthouse had become almost in- stantly a reason for going somewhere else. he had decided to live there because the view was so beautiful, because, from his vantage point, he seemed to be looking out on to the incarnation of a divine being. but who was he to be pampered with the daily and hourly sight of loveliness? who was he to be living in the visible presence of god? all he deserved to live in was some filthy sty, some blind hole in the ground. stiff and still aching after his long night of pain, but for that very reason inwardly reassured, he climbed up to the platform of his tower, he looked out over the bright sunrise world which he had re- gained the right to inhabit. on the north the view was bounded by the long chalk ridge of the hog's back, from behind whose eastern extrem- ity rose the towers of the seven skyscrapers which constituted guild- ford. seeing them, the savage made a grimace; but he was to become reconciled to them in course of time; for at night they twinkled gaily with geometrical constellations, or else, flood-lighted, pointed their luminous fingers (with a gesture whose significance nobody in england but the savage now understood) solemnly towards the plumbless mys- teries of heaven. in the valley which separated the hog's back from the sandy hill on which the lighthouse stood, puttenham was a modest little village nine stories high, with silos, a poultry farm, and a small vitamin-d factory. on the other side of the lighthouse, towards the south, the ground fell away in long slopes of heather to a chain of ponds. beyond them, above the intervening woods, rose the fourteen-story tower of elstead. dim in the hazy english air, hindhead and selborne invited the eye into a blue romantic distance. but it was not alone the distance that had attracted the savage to his lighthouse; the near was as seductive as the far. the woods, the open stretches of heather and yellow gorse, the clumps of scotch firs, the shining ponds with their overhanging birch trees, their water lilies, their beds of rushes-these were beautiful and, to an eye accustomed to the aridities of the ameri- can desert, astonishing. and then the solitude! whole days passed during which he never saw a human being. the lighthouse was only a quarter of an hour's flight from the charing-t tower; but the hills of malpais were hardly more deserted than this surrey heath. the crowds that daily left london, left it only to play electro-magnetic golf or ten- nis. puttenham possessed no links; the nearest riemann-surfaces were at guildford. flowers and a landscape were the only attractions here. and so, as there was no good reason for coming, nobody came. during the first days the savage lived alone and undisturbed. of the money which, on his first arrival, john had received for his per- sonal expenses, most had been spent on his equipment. before leaving london he had bought four viscose-woollen blankets, rope and string, nails, glue, a few tools, matches (though he intended in due course to make a fire drill), some pots and pans, two dozen packets of seeds, and ten kilogrammes of wheat flour. \"no, not synthetic starch and cotton-waste flour-substitute,\" he had insisted. \"even though it is more nourishing.\" but when it came to pan-glandular biscuits and vi- taminized beef-surrogate, he had not been able to resist the shop- man's persuasion. looking at the tins now, he bitterly reproached him- self for his weakness. loathesome civilized stuff! he had made up his mind that he would never eat it, even if he were starving. \"that'll teach them,\" he thought vindictively. it would also teach him. he counted his money. the little that remained would be enough, he hoped, to tide him over the winter. by next spring, his garden would be producing enough to make him independent of the outside world. meanwhile, there would always be game. he had seen plenty of rab- bits, and there were waterfowl on the ponds. he set to work at once to make a bow and arrows. there were ash trees near the lighthouse and, for arrow shafts, a whole copse full of beautifully straight hazel saplings. he began by fell- ing a young ash, cut out six feet of unbranched stem, stripped off the bark and, paring by paring, shaved away the white wood, as old mit- sima had taught him, until he had a stave of his own height, stiff at the thickened centre, lively and quick at the slender tips. the work gave him an intense pleasure. after those weeks of idleness in london, with nothing to do, whenever he wanted anything, but to press a switch or turn a handle, it was pure delight to be doing something that demanded skill and patience. he had almost finished whittling the stave into shape, when he real- ized with a start that he was singing-s/ng/'ng/ it was as though, stum- bling upon himself from the outside, he had suddenly caught himself out, taken himself flagrantly at fault. guiltily he blushed. after all, it was not to sing and enjoy himself that he had come here. it was to es- cape further contamination by the filth of civilized life; it was to be pu- rified and made good; it was actively to make amends. he realized to his dismay that, absorbed in the whittling of his bow, he had forgotten what he had sworn to himself he would constantly remember-poor linda, and his own murderous unkindness to her, and those loathsome twins, swarming like lice across the mystery of her death, insulting, with their presence, not merely his own grief and repentance, but the very gods themselves. he had sworn to remember, he had sworn un- ceasingly to make amends. and there was he, sitting happily over his bow-stave, singing, actually singing. ... he went indoors, opened the box of mustard, and put some water to boil on the fire. half an hour later, three delta-minus landworkers from one of the put- tenham bokanovsky groups happened to be driving to elstead and, at the top of the hill, were astonished to see a young man standing out- side the abandoned lighthouse stripped to the waist and hitting himself with a whip of knotted cords. his back was horizontally streaked with crimson, and from weal to weal ran thin trickles of blood. the driver of the lorry pulled up at the side of the road and, with his two compan- ions, stared open-mouthed at the extraordinary spectacle. one, two three-they counted the strokes. after the eighth, the young man inter- rupted his self-punishment to run to the wood's edge and there be vio- lently sick. when he had finished, he picked up the whip and began hitting himself again. nine, ten, eleven, twelve ... \"ford!\" whispered the driver. and his twins were of the same opinion. \"fordey!\" they said. three days later, like turkey buzzards settling on a corpse, the report- ers came. dried and hardened over a slow fire of green wood, the bow was ready. the savage was busy on his arrows. thirty hazel sticks had been whittled and dried, tipped with sharp nails, carefully nocked. he had made a raid one night on the puttenham poultry farm, and now had feathers enough to equip a whole armoury. it was at work upon the feathering of his shafts that the first of the reporters found him. noiseless on his pneumatic shoes, the man came up behind him. \"good-morning, mr. savage,\" he said. \"i am the representative of the hourly radio.\" startled as though by the bite of a snake, the savage sprang to his feet, scattering arrows, feathers, glue-pot and brush in all directions. \"i beg your pardon,\" said the reporter, with genuine compunction. \"i had no intention ...\" he touched his hat-the aluminum stove-pipe hat in which he carried his wireless receiver and transmitter. \"excuse my not taking it off,\" he said. \"it's a bit heavy. well, as i was saying, i am the representative of the hourly ...\" \"what do you want?\" asked the savage, scowling. the reporter re- turned his most ingratiating smile. \"well, of course, our readers would be profoundly interested ...\" he put his head on one side, his smile became almost coquettish. \"just a few words from you, mr. savage.\" and rapidly, with a series of ritual ges- tures, he uncoiled two wires connected to the portable battery buckled round his waist; plugged them simultaneously into the sides of his aluminum hat; touched a spring on the crown-and antennae shot up into the air; touched another spring on the peak of the brim-and, like a jack-in-the-box, out jumped a microphone and hung there, quiver- ing, six inches in front of his nose; pulled down a pair of receivers over his ears; pressed a switch on the left side of the hat-and from within came a faint waspy buzzing; turned a knob on the right-and the buzz- ing was interrupted by a stethoscopic wheeze and cackle, by hiccoughs and sudden squeaks. \"hullo,\" he said to the microphone, \"hullo, hullo ...\" a bell suddenly rang inside his hat. \"is that you, edzel? primo mel- lon speaking. yes, i've got hold of him. mr. savage will now take the microphone and say a few words. won't you, mr. savage?\" he looked up at the savage with another of those winning smiles of his. \"just tell our readers why you came here. what made you leave london (hold on, edzel!) so very suddenly. and, of course, that whip.\" (the savage started. how did they know about the whip?) \"we're all crazy to know about the whip. and then something about civilization. you know the sort of stuff. 'what i think of the civilized girl.' just a few words, a very few ...\" the savage obeyed with a disconcerting literalness. five words he ut- tered and no more-five words, the same as those he had said to ber- nard about the arch-community-songster of canterbury. \"hani! sons eso tse-na!\" and seizing the reporter by the shoulder, he spun him round (the young man revealed himself invitingly well-covered), aimed and, with all the force and accuracy of a champion foot-and-mouth- baller, delivered a most prodigious kick. eight minutes later, a new edition of the hourly radio was on sale in the streets of london. \"hourly radio reporter has coccyx kicked by mystery savage,\" ran the headlines on the front page. \"sensation in surrey.\" \"sensation even in london,\" thought the reporter when, on his return, he read the words. and a very painful sensation, what was more. he sat down gingerly to his luncheon. undeterred by that cautionary bruise on their colleague's coccyx, four other reporters, representing the new york times, the frankfurt four- dimensional continuum, the fordian science monitor, and the delta mirror, called that afternoon at the lighthouse and met with receptions of progressively increasing violence. from a safe distance and still rubbing his buttocks, \"benighted fool!\" shouted the man from the fordian science monitor, \"why don't you take soma?\" \"get away!\" the savage shook his fist. the other retreated a few steps then turned round again. \"evil's an un- reality if you take a couple of grammes.\" \"kohakwa iyathtokyai!\"the tone was menacingly derisive. \"pain's a delusion.\" \"oh, is it?\" said the savage and, picking up a thick hazel switch, strode forward. the man from the fordian science monitor made a dash for his heli- copter. after that the savage was left for a time in peace. a few helicopters came and hovered inquisitively round the tower. he shot an arrow into the importunately nearest of them. it pierced the aluminum floor of the cabin; there was a shrill yell, and the machine went rocketing up into the air with all the acceleration that its super-charger could give it. the others, in future, kept their distance respectfully. ignoring their tiresome humming (he likened himself in his imagination to one of the suitors of the maiden of matsaki, unmoved and persistent among the winged vermin), the savage dug at what was to be his garden. after a time the vermin evidently became bored and flew away; for hours at a stretch the sky above his head was empty and, but for the larks, si- lent. the weather was breathlessly hot, there was thunder in the air. he had dug all the morning and was resting, stretched out along the floor. and suddenly the thought of lenina was a real presence, naked and tangi- ble, saying \"sweet!\" and \"put your arms round me!\"-in shoes and socks, perfumed. impudent strumpet! but oh, oh, her arms round his neck, the lifting of her breasts, her mouth! eternity was in our lips and eyes. lenina ... no, no, no, no! he sprang to his feet and, half naked as he was, ran out of the house. at the edge of the heath stood a clump of hoary juniper bushes. he flung himself against them, he embraced, not the smooth body of his desires, but an armful of green spikes. sharp, with a thousand points, they pricked him. he tried to think of poor linda, breathless and dumb, with her clutching hands and the unutterable terror in her eyes. poor linda whom he had sworn to re- member. but it was still the presence of lenina that haunted him. len- ina whom he had promised to forget. even through the stab and sting of the juniper needles, his wincing flesh was aware of her, unescapably real. \"sweet, sweet ... and if you wanted me too, why didn't you ...\" the whip was hanging on a nail by the door, ready to hand against the arrival of reporters. in a frenzy the savage ran back to the house, seized it, whirled it. the knotted cords bit into his flesh. \"strumpet! strumpet!\" he shouted at every blow as though it were lenina (and how frantically, without knowing it, he wished it were), white, warm, scented, infamous lenina that he was dogging thus. \"strumpet!\" and then, in a voice of despair, \"oh, linda, forgive me. forgive me, god. i'm bad. i'm wicked. i'm ... no, no, you strumpet, you strumpet!\" from his carefully constructed hide in the wood three hundred metres away, darwin bonaparte, the feely corporation's most expert big game photographer had watched the whole proceedings. patience and skill had been rewarded. he had spent three days sitting inside the bole of an artificial oak tree, three nights crawling on his belly through the heather, hiding microphones in gorse bushes, burying wires in the soft grey sand. seventy-two hours of profound discomfort. but now me great moment had come-the greatest, darwin bonaparte had time to reflect, as he moved among his instruments, the greatest since his taking of the famous all-howling stereoscopic feely of the gorillas' wedding. \"splendid,\" he said to himself, as the savage started his as- tonishing performance. \"splendid!\" he kept his telescopic cameras carefully aimed-glued to their moving objective; clapped on a higher power to get a close-up of the frantic and distorted face (admirable!); switched over, for half a minute, to slow motion (an exquisitely comical effect, he promised himself); listened in, meanwhile, to the blows, the groans, the wild and raving words that were being recorded on the sound-track at the edge of his film, tried the effect of a little amplifica- tion (yes, that was decidedly better); was delighted to hear, in a mo- mentary lull, the shrill singing of a lark; wished the savage would turn round so that he could get a good close-up of the blood on his back- and almost instantly (what astonishing luck!) the accommodating fel- low did turn round, and he was able to take a perfect close-up. \"well, that was grand!\" he said to himself when it was all over. \"really grand!\" he mopped his face. when they had put in the feely effects at the studio, it would be a wonderful film. almost as good, thought dar- win bonaparte, as the sperm whale's love-life-and that, by ford, was saying a good deal! twelve days later the savage of surrey had been released and could be seen, heard and felt in every first-class feely-palace in western europe. the effect of darwin bonaparte's film was immediate and enormous. on the afternoon which followed the evening of its release john's rustic solitude was suddenly broken by the arrival overhead of a great swarm of helicopters. he was digging in his garden-digging, too, in his own mind, laboriously turning up the substance of his thought. death-and he drove in his spade once, and again, and yet again. and all our yesterdays have lighted fools the way to dusty death. a convincing thunder rumbled through the words. he lifted another spadeful of earth. why had linda died? why had she been allowed to become gradually less than human and at last ... he shuddered. a good kissing carrion. he planted his foot on his spade and stamped it fiercely into the tough ground. as flies to wanton boys are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport. thunder again; words that proclaimed themselves true-truer somehow than truth itself. and yet that same gloucester had called them ever-gentle gods. besides, thy best of rest is sleep and that thou oft provok'st; yet grossly fear'st thy death which is no more. no more than sleep. sleep. perchance to dream. his spade struck against a stone; he stooped to pick it up. for in that sleep of death, what dreams? ... a humming overhead had become a roar; and suddenly he was in shadow, there was something between the sun and him. he looked up, startled, from his digging, from his thoughts; looked up in a dazzled bewilderment, his mind still wandering in that other world of truer- than-truth, still focused on the immensities of death and deity; looked up and saw, close above him, the swarm of hovering machines. like locusts they came, hung poised, descended all around him on the heather. and from out of the bellies of these giant grasshoppers stepped men in white viscose-flannels, women (for the weather was hot) in acetate-shantung pyjamas or velveteen shorts and sleeveless, half-unzippered singlets-one couple from each. in a few minutes there were dozens of them, standing in a wide circle round the lighthouse, staring, laughing, clicking their cameras, throwing (as to an ape) pea- nuts, packets of sex-hormone chewing-gum, pan-glandular petite beurres. and every moment-for across the hog's back the stream of traffic now flowed unceasingly-their numbers increased. as in a nightmare, the dozens became scores, the scores hundreds. the savage had retreated towards cover, and now, in the posture of an animal at bay, stood with his back to the wall of the lighthouse, staring from face to face in speechless horror, like a man out of his senses. from this stupor he was aroused to a more immediate sense of reality by the impact on his cheek of a well-aimed packet of chewing-gum. a shock of startling pain-and he was broad awake, awake and fiercely angry. \"go away!\" he shouted. the ape had spoken; there was a burst of laughter and hand-clapping. \"good old savage! hurrah, hurrah!\" and through the babel he heard cries of: \"whip, whip, the whip!\" acting on the word's suggestion, he seized the bunch of knotted cords from its nail behind the door and shook it at his tormentors. there was a yell of ironical applause. menacingly he advanced towards them. a woman cried out in fear. the line wavered at its most immediately threatened point, then stiffened again, stood firm. the consciousness of being in overwhelming force had given these sightseers a courage which the savage had not ex- pected of them. taken aback, he halted and looked round. \"why don't you leave me alone?\" there was an almost plaintive note in his anger. \"have a few magnesium-salted almonds!\" said the man who, if the savage were to advance, would be the first to be attacked. he held out a packet. \"they're really very good, you know,\" he added, with a rather nervous smile of propitiation. \"and the magnesium salts will help to keep you young.\" the savage ignored his offer. \"what do you want with me?\" he asked, turning from one grinning face to another. \"what do you want with me?\" \"the whip,\" answered a hundred voices confusedly. \"do the whipping stunt. let's see the whipping stunt.\" then, in unison and on a slow, heavy rhythm, \"we-want-the whip,\" shouted a group at the end of the line. \"we-want-the whip.\" others at once took up the cry, and the phrase was repeated, parrot- fashion, again and again, with an ever-growing volume of sound, until, by the seventh or eighth reiteration, no other word was being spoken. \"we-want-the whip.\" they were all crying together; and, intoxicated by the noise, the una- nimity, the sense of rhythmical atonement, they might, it seemed, have gone on for hours-almost indefinitely. but at about the twenty- fifth repetition the proceedings were startlingly interrupted. yet an- other helicopter had arrived from across the hog's back, hung poised above the crowd, then dropped within a few yards of where the sav- age was standing, in the open space between the line of sightseers and the lighthouse. the roar of the air screws momentarily drowned the shouting; then, as the machine touched the ground and the en- gines were turned off: \"we-want-the whip; we-want-the whip,\" broke out again in the same loud, insistent monotone. the door of the helicopter opened, and out stepped, first a fair and ruddy-faced young man, then, in green velveteen shorts, white shirt, and jockey cap, a young woman. at the sight of the young woman, the savage started, recoiled, turned pale. the young woman stood, smiling at him-an uncertain, imploring, al- most abject smile. the seconds passed. her lips moved, she was say- ing something; but the sound of her voice was covered by the loud re- iterated refrain of the sightseers. \"we-want-the whip! we-want-the whip!\" the young woman pressed both hands to her left side, and on that peach-bright, doll-beautiful face of hers appeared a strangely incon- gruous expression of yearning distress. her blue eyes seemed to grow larger, brighter; and suddenly two tears rolled down her cheeks. inau- dibly, she spoke again; then, with a quick, impassioned gesture stretched out her arms towards the savage, stepped forward. \"we-want-the whip! we-want ...\" and all of a sudden they had what they wanted. \"strumpet!\" the savage had rushed at her like a madman. \"fitchew!\" like a madman, he was slashing at her with his whip of small cords. terrified, she had turned to flee, had tripped and fallen in the heather. \"henry, henry!\" she shouted. but her ruddy-faced companion had bolted out of harm's way behind the helicopter. with a whoop of delighted excitement the line broke; there was a con- vergent stampede towards that magnetic centre of attraction. pain was a fascinating horror. \"fry, lechery, fry!\" frenzied, the savage slashed again. hungrily they gathered round, pushing and scrambling like swine about the trough. \"oh, the flesh!\" the savage ground his teeth. this time it was on his shoulders that the whip descended. \"kill it, kill it!\" drawn by the fascination of the horror of pain and, from within, im- pelled by that habit of cooperation, that desire for unanimity and atonement, which their conditioning had so ineradicably implanted in them, they began to mime the frenzy of his gestures, striking at one another as the savage struck at his own rebellious flesh, or at that plump incarnation of turpitude writhing in the heather at his feet. \"kill it, kill it, kill it ...\" the savage went on shouting. then suddenly somebody started singing \"orgy-porgy\" and, in a mo- ment, they had all caught up the refrain and, singing, had begun to dance. orgy-porgy, round and round and round, beating one another in six-eight time. orgy-porgy ... it was after midnight when the last of the helicopters took its flight. stupefied by soma, and exhausted by a long-drawn frenzy of sensual- ity, the savage lay sleeping in the heather. the sun was already high when he awoke. he lay for a moment, blinking in owlish incomprehen- sion at the light; then suddenly remembered-everything. \"oh, my god, my god!\" he covered his eyes with his hand. that evening the swarm of helicopters that came buzzing across the hog's back was a dark cloud ten kilometres long. the description of last night's orgy of atonement had been in all the papers. \"savage!\" called the first arrivals, as they alighted from their machine. \"mr. savage!\" there was no answer. the door of the lighthouse was ajar. they pushed it open and walked into a shuttered twilight. through an archway on the further side of the room they could see the bottom of the staircase that led up to the higher floors. just under the crown of the arch dangled a pair of feet. \"mr. savage!\" slowly, very slowly, like two unhurried compass needles, the feet turned towards the right; north, north-east, east, south-east, south, south-south-west; then paused, and, after a few seconds, turned as unhurriedly back towards the left. south-south-west, south, south- east, east. ..."
